At noon this coming Tuesday, Feb. 23d, our very of Bob Thompson will be presenting at the faculty workshop in the Hotung Faculty Dining Room.  Lunch will be served.

As always, the expectation is that those attending the workshop will have read the paper beforehand.

Bob contextualizes the paper as follows:

The attached essay is an overview of a book project that examines corporate personality focusing on both traditional corporate characteristics like limited liability, arbitrage, magnification, and anonymity, and recent Supreme Court illustrations from Citizens United and Hobby Lobby.  You likely have much to say about the Supreme Court cases. I would welcome the degree to which you would want to engage in how they relate to the corporate law aspects presented here. RBT
