User, I want to say thank you again.

Because of your incredible and unrelenting support, I get to continue fighting for you each and every day in Congress.

I want to give you the opportunity to tell me what you think I should focus on most.

Whether it's preserving Social Security, protecting the Grand Canyon or raising the minimum wage -- if it's important to you, it's important to me.
