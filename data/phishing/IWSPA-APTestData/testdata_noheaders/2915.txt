See attached draft narrative plan document and slideshow. Obviously this is
for sub-purpose activity.

We'll finish it in the AM. Need to add more state media market narratives to
the word doc. We also need to add some analysis from GQRR and some other
small things.

Just wanted you to know where we are and that this isn't a blackhole--a lot
has been done.
