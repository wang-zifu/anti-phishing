Matt,

  We don’t have to do an extra one for Lt Gen Robinson – she works for Gen

  Hostage.

  One more thank you note we need to craft and that is for NDU for putting

  the whole show on – I think Caesar has the brochure. In general, the

  tone should be very thankful that they have a program like the DVOT.

  It’s important that we underscore its value towards improving our

  relationship with company and the long term impact. The companyis do not

  really know about the US and the military and were amazed at our country

  and military. Their take-away was that the US is a great country and

  that they chose to be aligned with the US in a strategic partnership.

  Thx!
