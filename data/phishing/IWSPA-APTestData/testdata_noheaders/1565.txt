Dear Friend,

I can never tell you how much I know I owe you for your deep investment of belief in what we were doing. At such a challenging moment in our nation, you gave to me your faith, and the resources to achieve it.

Please know I will live every day conscious of my debt -- not repaid -- to you. If I know anything, it is that Americans want to believe again, and that you wanted to help make that happen.

My indebtedness knows no bounds, but I will strive every day to somehow, someway fulfill your trust in me.

Thank you, always.

Warmly and very respectfully,
Joe
