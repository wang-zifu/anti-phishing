Hi, User:

Hope all is well and that you are will be able to take some time off from
the campaign during the summer.

Just touching base. Your last email to me said there would be hiring at end
of August/Labor Day in HRCs campaign. Hope you can help me to get in the
door to speak with someone in the campaign and at least get a look by the
campaign. I  had preliminary conversations with Jennifer Palmieri's
communications operation and with Amanda Renteria back in early June. I
believe my experience would be an excellent match for either political or
communications. But, I am willing to serve wherever the campaign needs
helps the most.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Chris
