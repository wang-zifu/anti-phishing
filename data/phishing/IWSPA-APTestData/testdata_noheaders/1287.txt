Hi all.

Attached is a draft post repurposing the messaging from HRC's Women for
Hillary launch speech to run on BlogHer in conjunction with the release of
the Women for Hillary video Wednesday or Thursday. Megan has given this a
scrub.

Apologies for the quick turn, but please send edits/approvals by *6 pm
today* so we can send to the book.

Thanks,

Kristina
