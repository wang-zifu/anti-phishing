Spectacular, appreciate, but I don't bitch, I offer sound advice and actionable
suggestions, and while I don't often say I told you so, the advice has largely
been proven right which, had it been taken long ago, would have left her in a far
better position that she finds herself in now.  One of my greatest fears is that she
does not hear enough alternate advice, I don't mean you, I do mean many others.
But I am thrilled about the pope, and will look for the first opportunity to praise it
publicly.....and note, I have kept most of my concerns private and fiercely defended
her publicly unlike many Democrats.....
