Hi User,

We are putting together the details for the cooking portion of the June 5th
event and wanted to check with you about your menu and what cookware you
will need. The cooking area will have two burners and the caterer is happy
to bring in the other items you will need.

Nora was thinking of creating a menu around seasonal produce so a possible
menu (but still very much a work in progress):

. grilled & sauteed asparagus
. cheese pastry cup with spring garlic & herbs
. sweet rhubarb compote and maple syrup

If you have a particular menu in mind please let me know so we can be sure
to have everything in order.

Thanks so much!
Marguerite
