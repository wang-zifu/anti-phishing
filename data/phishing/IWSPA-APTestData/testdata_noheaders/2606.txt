TRUMP: And then in the meantime, as you know, there was a picture a few weeks ago, it was all over the place, that Lee Harvey Oswald and his father a few months before...

HANNITY: Was that verified before....I saw something on the domain.com

TRUMP: It was a picture put in...and they wouldn't put it in if they couldn't be sued, that I can tell you. They are very big professionals. It was put in, and by the way, Ted Cruz I don't think denied it at the news conference. They don't do things unless they can be verified.
