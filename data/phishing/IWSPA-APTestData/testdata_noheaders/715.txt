"A Festivus for the rest of us! Thursday, December 19 Happy Hour 

Non-stop holiday merchandising got you miffed? Do you find tinsel distracting? Ready to setup an unadorned aluminum pole? It’s beginning to look a lot like Festivus!

Join us tomorrow from 6 – 8 p.m. at the Commissary to celebrate Festivus, the holiday made famous by SEINFELD, at the weekly Happy Hour sponsored by organization Pictures Television. Bring your colleagues, family and friends to air your grievances, take a photo with the Festivus pole, and enjoy $1 beer and wine and affordable appetizers.

Steve
