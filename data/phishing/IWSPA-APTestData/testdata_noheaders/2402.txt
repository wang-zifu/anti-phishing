User, Todd

Attached is the reworked version.   As you'll see, it takes a more 
prescriptive approach, based on the input from last Friday.

The key pages to look at include:

- 4 major design decisions
- 10 decision rights as to personnel
- 12, 13 (structural overview and org chart)
-  24, 25 (10 key outstanding questions for the board)

Thanks.  I'm available at any time if you have questions or 
comments/edits.
