User, HRC can run with my suggestion here of creating up to 10 one billion dollar
awards for inventors, scientists etc who invent major breakthroughs to reduce the
dangers of climate change.  Would bring huge progress on climate change and
create millions of new jobs.  If the high standards are not met for the inventions,
no money is paid, if they are, the cost is cheap.  A private sector version of the 
JFK moon shot, for climate change, based on unprecedented incentives for
unprecedented inventions....
