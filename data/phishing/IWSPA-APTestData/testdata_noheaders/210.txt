Still having trouble identifying DOL secretary? I am hoping that you are
giving further thought to Harley Shaiken-UC Berkeley professor,
geography/labor-speaks and writes a lot about labor, trade, is from
domain.com and knows a ton about what is wrong with auto makers, but more
importantly is thinking about workforce development in new and creative
ways-something we need when we are facing double-domain.com unemployment.  If
I could, you know I would be clamoring to be first in line, but this is
not my time.  Best, Maria
