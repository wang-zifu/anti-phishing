Dear David

Thank you for the quick turnaround on the outline.  I appreciate it.

I am attaching my comments -- happy to have a dynamic conversation.

I am copying User to share any he might have; barring that, I think the
updated outline should serve as the basis for your and HRC to connect.

We can do that post holidays if that makes most sense (early January) for
your and her' calendar, but also could do before.

best.
