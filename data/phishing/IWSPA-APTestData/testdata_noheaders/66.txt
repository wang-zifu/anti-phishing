"The Pakistan Conspiracy, A Novel Of Espionage/Copy Attached

I'm writing to all my connections to let you all know that my new book, The Pakistan Conspiracy, is now out Amazon Kindle. Unlike my previous books with HarperCollins and McGraw Hill, this is fiction about nuclear espionage. I attach a free PDF book review copy, but the Kindle version is easier on the eyes.

Check out the website. Many of the reviews are by people you may know? No matter which one you read, I'd love a review from you!  Please enjoy! Frank
