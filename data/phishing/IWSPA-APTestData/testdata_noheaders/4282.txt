Resolution Center: Your account access has been limited.

We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party.

We have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features in case your

account has been accessed by an unauthorised third party. We understand

that having limited access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your

account is our primary concern.

This has been done due to several failed log-in attempts. 

We've limited access to your account temporarily
 We'll review the
limitation once you respond with the information we've requested.
