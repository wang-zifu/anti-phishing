Dear Colleagues,

GMS will be unavailable beginning at 5:00 PM EDT on Friday August 7 to load FY13 and FY14 correction journals. GMS will be available Saturday morning after the normal weekly maintenance.

The outage is limited to GMS and does not impact the Georgetown network. The only impact for GU employees is that they will not be able to access GMS from any domain.com connection (GU or otherwise).

We apologize for any inconvenience. If you encounter any GMS issues once access has been restored, please contact the Service Center by emailing user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> or calling (202) 687-4949.

Thank you for your attention.

Pim Thukral
VP, Financial Accounting and Systems

Charles DeSantis
AVP, Benefits, Payroll and Wellness
Chief Benefits Officer
