Quick statement:

"The chair of the Republican National Convention and the highest-ranking Republican official in the country just said he couldn't support his party's nominee for president. That's a shocker - since Ryan and his fellow House Republicans paved the way for Trump with their extreme rhetoric, divisive policies, and obstruction. No matter how hard he tries to run away from Trump, Ryan can't protect his colleagues from the downballot destruction that their party's nominee will cause. P.S. - Ryan's district is only R+3.
