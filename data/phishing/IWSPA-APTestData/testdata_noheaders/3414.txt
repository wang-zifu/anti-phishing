Mike Dorning here from Bloomberg. Cell 202-503-7022. Seeking any help you can give me on background re. Keystone. We're hearing decision likely next week, all indications point to rejection. Editors are very anxious to break story. Appreciate anything you share anonymously re. What decision is or when it will come.

Any advance heads-up much appreciated. Hope all well with you. 

Best,

Mike
