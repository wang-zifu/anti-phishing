I just wanted to send you a quick note and tell you how pleased (for the President, the country and the agenda) I was to see your news today. I also wanted to reach out and offer to be of assistance. If it's helpful to you, I would be happy to get together to walk through 5+ years of my knowledge on the issues, including what's currently pending. It's not a secret that there are some challenges, as well as major opportunities.
