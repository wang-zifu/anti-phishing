So I don’t know if it went un-reported or was just buried below all the
Trump hysteria, but deep in the tabs of the CNN poll are gen election
head-to-heads (among registered voters):

HRC 51 – Bush 46
HRC 56 – Trump 40
HRC 53 – Walker 44

These margins are closer than their June poll (which if you recall, was
ridiculous)

Sanders runs even with Bush, leads Trump by 19 and leads Walker by 5.
