Hello-

Attached is another revision of the McCain survey.  It is currently at
25 minutes exactly, so please take that into account when making further
edits.  As for the timing of this poll, are there any more thoughts on
fielding tomorrow versus holding off?  Or is the consensus to domain.com for
tonight's results? 

Tom-- Do you think we can do a quick call today with you in order to
discuss the implications for the upcoming research and timeline for the
ads?

Thanks all!  Kristi
