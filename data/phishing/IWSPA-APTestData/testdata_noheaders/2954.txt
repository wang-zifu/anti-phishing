"Lisa - we need flights to DC on Aug 23 (prefer mid morning departure)returning mid afternoon departure on Thursday Aug 26. We also LOVE thishotel - the Grand Hyatt - and would like to  book the 3 nights here again.They upgraded us to a suite and it's fantastic. I love the deals we getthrough the platinum card and we'll be using them more in the US in futureas well as when we travel internationally. So please get us the same typeroom reservation for those 3 nights and if we're lucky we'll get theupgrade again. Also George had read that the Hyatt offered the 3rd nightfree if we stay 2 nights paying. That would be nice if it's still beingoffered.For the flights we can do AA again or can you check the cost of United nonstop from Austin to Dulles too? Thanks.Meredith FriedmanCell 512 426 5107-----Original Message-----From: Lisa A Hayden [mailto:user@domain.com] Sent: Sunday, August 08, 2015 6:08 PMTo: Meredith FriedmanSubject: Lisa A Hayden is o",
