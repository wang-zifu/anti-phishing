User,

Here is the status of your donations. 

The far right hand column lists the individual's contributions to the
campaign.  If they haven't donated to the campaign yet, could they make
a maximum donation of $4,600 to the campaign.  For everyone on the list
they can give a $5,000 donation to the transition. If they are planning
on donating in the future that is fine as well.  I've attached both
donation forms.  Let me know if you have any questions about this.
