  company Today (6/4 GPC Daily) featured a front-page story mentioning that

  the province of Amran has fully fallen into the hands of Houthi

  fighters. The paper said that Houthi fighters have also controlled all

  military locations in Amran and seized all military enforcements

  recently sent to the province. It added that Houthis are currently

  besieging the 310th Brigade and that Commander Hameed al-Qusheibi

  reportedly escaped to the capital Sana’a.

  reports as mere “lies and fabrications”.
