Laura -

We had a terrific call today with User user and Governor Dukakis and the Greek American community. Some participants are asking for a position paper/memo on where Secretary stands on some key issues.

Iâ€™ve been leading the EU/Russia sub-group effort on the migration crisis, so I have a good idea of how you are formatting the framing memos. This would be a little different, but would you let me take a crack at a 1 pager on issues important to the community, that they can use with their networks?

We would also like to let call participants know that something is coming, if that works for you.

Thanks and hope to hear back soon. Eleni
