All,

  Please find below a roundup of media coverage of yesterday’s events on

  Airport Road.

  Multiple media (9/7-8) reported that riot police on Sunday used water

  cannons and tear gas as they briefly broke up a Houthi sit-in blocking

  Sana’a’s airport road. Other reports mentioned that the road to the

  airport was once again blocked when protesters set up their tents again

  as security forces bulled out.

  Protesters responded by throwing rocks at right police and security

  vehicles.

  Houthi media (9/7-8) claimed that one person died and that 40 others

  wounded in the clashes, while several protesters had suffered from tear

  gas inhalation.

  Houthi spokesperson, Mohamed Abdulsalam said in a statement that the

  attempts to disperse the sit-in will only deepen the crisis, depicting

  it as a “foolish act.” Abdulsalam said that “We hold the government

  responsible for the repercussions of its aggression, and we emphasize

  our people's right to self-defense by all mean
