Jennifer, Faiz and Amanda,

Nice meeting each of you following my meeting with User last week in DC.

Wanted to find a time for a call that I could follow-up with you to discuss
how we may partner with each of our 8 states--CA, CO, FL, MN, MI, OH, WA and
WI.

Let me know what works.

Have a nice weekend.
