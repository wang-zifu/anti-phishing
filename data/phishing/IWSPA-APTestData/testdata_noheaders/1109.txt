Def not the chair. OAN is very right wing. I would expect that if you try to give sound on this, then they will pull a "by the way, while I've got you here, would you mind talking about Hillary's emails / Benghazi / joint fundraising committee / some other domain.com". They don't need the Organizationin order to produce this story. I would politely decline and just say that we want to keep our fingerprints off of this one.
