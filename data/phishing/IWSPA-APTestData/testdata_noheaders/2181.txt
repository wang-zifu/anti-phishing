Dear User:

Most of all, I look forward to working with you and involving you in this 
enterprise. 

Enclosed please find:

- a participant list
- a mission statement
- the current draft of the paper and compiled participant reactions

We'll have a new draft to you in about a week or so, which will represent 
the summary of our discussions to date.

As I mentioned, our aim is to reduce this to a 25-page real strategy 
paper.

You should feel free to contact any member of the group directly.

Allbest,
Les
