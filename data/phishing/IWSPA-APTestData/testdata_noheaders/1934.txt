Attached is a memo on the Economic Team options.  I will draft a cover
memo that puts it in context.  We have not included recommendations, but
I am happy to do so, particularly if we agree:

NEC:  Oszag
OMB:  Greenstein
Treasury:  Geithner or Summers
CEA:  Goolsbee
Commerce:  Pritzker
USTR:  Tyson or Locke
HUD:  Kirk
SEC:  Cohen or Pozen

Thoughts?

We're working on the Homeland Security one.
