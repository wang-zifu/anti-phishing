"Global Legal Meeting -- Save a Different Date

All,

With the change to the dates for the Global Compliance Conference, we will also be changing the date of the Global Legal Meeting.  

Please change your calendars to save Tuesday, May 20, 2015 for the Global Legal Meeting.  We will still plan on having both morning and afternoon sessions that day and will plan an enjoyable dinner that evening.

If you forget to change your calendar and show up on Monday, we’ll try to find you some office space and get you a sandwich from the cafeteria to hold you over until the scheduled activities commence Tuesday morning!

Best regards, 

Natsuko, Masa and Mark
