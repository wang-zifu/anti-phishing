Dear Mr. user,

It was great to meet you again following the discussion at Georgetown on Pope Francis' Environmental Encyclical. I took away a great deal from the panel and wanted to thank you for your reflections.

As I briefly shared, we met earlier this year at the White House Fellows lunch talk that you gave. I recently completed my Fellowship year serving in the US Mission to the UNâ€™s DC office. Prior to the Fellowship, I spent four years in the Sudans, most recently with UNDP. Currently, I am considering next steps and exploring options. I would be most grateful to meet and hear insights from your own transitions and experiences. If your schedule permits on your next domain.com to DC, could we meet? 

Many thanks,

Megan Carroll
