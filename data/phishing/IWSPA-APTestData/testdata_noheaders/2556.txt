My husband Jim McDermott's 100th Bruce Springsteen concert will be May 1st in Tampa (that will be my 42nd, as crazy as that sounds). It is an event of great significance to Jim and I know he would like nothing more than to actually meet Springsteen, if that is even possible. I couldn't think of anyone other than you who might know how I could make that happen, or if it is simply impossible. If there is anything you think I can do for Jim to just meet him and shake his hand, I would be very grateful. Best, Karin"
