" iBuilderSolomon,I currently have a membership that has been paid out for one or two years (I don't exactly remember).  Would that amount be accounted for in the overall payment for lifetime membership?  For example: if I paid $300 for a two year membership that began last November, would the remaining prorated amount be deducted from the $1999 owed for lifetime membership (just an example)?  I do not want to pay for the same upcoming year or so twice.If the amount cannot be reconciled with the term I have already paid for, then I will domain.com until I am closer to the end of my current membership term and then maybe opt for the lifetime term.v/rJim.",
