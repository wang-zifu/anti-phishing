We are hosting a FREE training* session for future political organizers <<>>on May 15th from 1pm-6pm. Campaign season is coming, and every campaign will want to hire talented Organizers. So learn the basics of political organizing now.
This training* is FREE but space is limited. You must apply by sending a resume and cover letter to user@domain.com

Please share with friends who might be interested.

*This training is for individuals who can work full-time as a Field Organizer on a campaign this year. This is not for current/future candidates or for people who just want to volunteer. We will have separate training sessions for that.
