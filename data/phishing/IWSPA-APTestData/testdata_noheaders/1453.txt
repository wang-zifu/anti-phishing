then what's with 15 members referenced in the letter for the drafting
committee? i'm confused

from the letter:

In our conversation, you told me with respect to the platform drafting
Committee that you would consider allowing each campaign to domain.com ten
Users from which you would choose four from each and then you would add an
additional seven. While having four members on the Drafting Committee is an
improvement, it does not address the fact that up to this point Bernie 2015 
has secured some 45% of the pledged delegates awarded. Frankly, we believe
that percentage will go up in the coming weeks and, of course, we hope it
will end up being a majority. I believe that each campaign should chose
seven members to serve on the Drafting Committee. The fifteenth member
would be a chair who would be jointly picked by the two campaigns
