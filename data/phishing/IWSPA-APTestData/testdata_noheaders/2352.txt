"A new color revolution in Georgia?   Your thesis that some US geopolitical concessions to Russia because of   Iran is very believable.  And maybe not backing Georgia so strongly is   part of it.  But your contention that the US orchestrates color   revolutions is off base.  You seem to totally discount the fact that the   populace of those countries are the primary forces behind the color   revolutions.  Are you really that cynical about democracy?       ************************************   Nick Deychakiwsky   Program Officer   C.S. Mott Foundation   503 S.
