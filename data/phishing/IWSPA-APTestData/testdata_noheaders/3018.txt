We need to be careful not to imply that Trump is a Nazi or that if you
remember the Holocaust, you will vote for Democrats. I would revise the
last paragraph to read something along the lines of:

The lessons of the Holocaust are especially important to remember during
election season, when the rhetoric of national politics will no doubt get
heated and our differences will be be exposed on the national stage. On
this Yom Hashoah, let us domain.com ourselves to the American values of
inclusion and diversity, and reject fear-mongering or the denigration of
any group of people because of their faith, race or gender. Let us pledge
today to continue to work to stop bigotry and hatred, knowing that our
nation will be stronger for it.=E2=80=9D
