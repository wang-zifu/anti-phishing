> I've done a draft memo to senior staff to set up procedures for how we respond to press inquiries across the entities that are being asked to respond. I've coordinated with Cheryl and her edits are contained in the attached draft. I wanted your input before sharing with a larger group. If you are ok with the approach outlined in the memo, which I think is consistent with our previous discussions, I'll share with David Kendall, and once he signs off I'll circulate to the broader group.
