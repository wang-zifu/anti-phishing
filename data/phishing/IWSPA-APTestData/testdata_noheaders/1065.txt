"A belated thanks for holiday gift

Dear Amy,

Just wanted to send my long-overdue thank you for the AmEx gift cards sent back in December… they came in very handy during a season when my home was full of ravenous college students and my fridge constantly required stocking! Hope you found comfort and joy during your time off. Here’s wishing you a very happy and prosperous 2014. 

Kind regards,

Jana Carole
