I heard from his this am - he is now interested in talking with HRC
off the record tomorrow in NH.  HRC called me on another matter (taxes
and health records) so I was able to talk with her about mark.  She
said she would be happy to talk to him off the record tomorrow if she
could fit it in the schedule.  I think 20 mins would be good.  Nick -
he is going to reach out to you to figure out.  I feel good about this
- think it will help.  HRC said if something good comes out of the
talk - she would be willing to put something on the record.  So we
will see hot it goes.  Thanks, all, and good luck today.
