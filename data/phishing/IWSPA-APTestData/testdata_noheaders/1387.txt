Miguel,

  Below is the standard statement I give to any contractor

  coming to company:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------------

  -Have valid visas (don’t rely on a planeside).

  -Travel in up-armored vehicles

  -Consider hiring a local security escort.   I’m aware of one company

  “organization Eagles for Security Services Ltd.  Sam Farran is an American

  and a security consultant for the company.  He can be reached at :

  user@domain.com , his number is +9671 410090 and Mobile:

  +967 1 410 909. I’m sure there are plenty of other companies available

  too however this is the only one for which I’m aware.  Griffin Group is

  another and I also believe AC4S provides the same service.

  -As for hotel:  the Movenpick is centrally located.  Most, if not all

  travelers, stay there.  From what I understand the cost is ~120.00 per

  night.
