"Official DGA Q&A Tonight

Good evening. Tonight the DGA screened American Hustle for the membership as part of their official screening series.

Taylor Hackford graciously moderated again which was recorded by the DGA. Taylor is a fan of the film and it shows in his conversation with David. They discussed topics ranging from the music choices, his AD team, the phenomenal acting performances, the shooting schedule and even the hair styling. Taylor and David discussed the screenplay and what was fiction.

The conversation was about 40 minutes and wonderful. Despite just arriving from a long plane trip from Dubai, David was great and the positive energy was evident and felt in the room by everyone.

Next is the official Academy screening. Another update to follow."
