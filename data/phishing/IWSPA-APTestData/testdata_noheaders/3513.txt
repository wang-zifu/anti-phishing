"MEXICO monograph, a reminder, KAREN   I haven't seen you on Spark or heard back after I sent you the Mexico   monograph for fact check yesterday (around 1:30 p.m.). I just want to make   sure I didn't miss it. Please advise. Thanks.   --   Michael McCullar   Senior Editor, Special Projects   STRATFOR   E-mail: user@domain.com   Tel: 512.744.4307   Cell: 512.970.5425   Fax: 512.744.4334"
