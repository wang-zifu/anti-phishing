Hope you had a good trip to the UK. Sorry not to be there.

I'm heading back on Sunday. The leadership race starts on Friday and runs through Sept 12. This is the most important phase for Labour in a long time, and I cannot sit on the side any longer.

I need to figure out how I fit all pieces of my life together, but I feel and urgency and importance about this at least in the early stage.

Really hope all is well with you, Mary and campaign -it seems to be going well -, and that we get the chance to catch up soon.

I hate to say it, but I warned that the Tories may get a million more votes....
