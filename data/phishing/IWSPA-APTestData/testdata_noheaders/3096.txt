Hey User,

As of noon, our GOTV team has talked to nearly 40,000 voters - but we need to talk to another 11,103 and get them in line before the polls close at 9 p.m. That takes vans, gas, water for our volunteers, and more. We can still do a LOT to ensure every Democrat in the Hudson Valley votes,  but we can't do it without you. We're spending our accounts down to zero to get out the vote - can you chip in $250 to keep us going for the last few hours?

Thank you so much for everything you've done. We can win this together.

- Sean
