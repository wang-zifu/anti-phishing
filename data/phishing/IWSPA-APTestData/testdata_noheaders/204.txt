Friend --

I just heard from my Finance Director Andrew -- he's tallied 
donations and we're just $1,245.45 short of our April goal 
with 7 hours to go.

I'm humbled by that support.

But we can't let up.

If 149 people each give $5, we'll hit our goal in time. Will you 
be one of them?

Give $5 right now: <<link>>

Thanks for your continued support,

Terry
