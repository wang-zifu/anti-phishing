Ladies and Gentlemen,

  It has been a pleasure to work with/for all of you during this

  deployment to Sana’a, company.  My Marines and I have enjoyed being the

  guardians of the USEMB and DTF-S and would have gladly destroyed the

  enemy given the situation.  In the end, we deterred any attack that may

  have been planned and it brings great joy to my men to know that they

  have contributed to such an important mission.  Thank you all for the

  support and I wish you all a safe time in the future.  My replacements

  are here and you are all in great hands.  The new Company Commander’s

  User is Capt Felix Guerra and his email is user@domain.com (also in

  the Cc line).

  Stay motivated and stay safe,

  Captain Hector L. Contreras

  Security Force Company Commander

  Sana’a company

  Company D (-), 1st Battalion 1st Marines
