"Hello QI have a question for you.  the client we are with right now from Campeche Mexico is having issues with infected Androids.  they start to lock up and burn the battery within hours.  Any ideas on that?  have you seen that before?by the way the one we have here was working ok for about a month with infection.  a couple of lock ups, but no major issue.  now it is just killing its battery really fast.  thanks for any insight you can give us.Alex VelascoKey Account ManagerHacking TeamMilan Singapore Washington DCwww.hackingteam.comemail: user@domain.com: +1 301.332.5654phone: +1 443.949.7470"
