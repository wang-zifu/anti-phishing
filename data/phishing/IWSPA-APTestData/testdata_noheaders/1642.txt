"Hi Sergio, I take note and then I’ll you know. Thanks for your cooperation. Ciao  Antonella CapaldoAdministrative Support Hacking TeamMilan Singapore Washington DCwww.hackingteam.comemail: user@domain.com:+39 3667216471phone: +39 0229060603 Da: ""Sergio R.-Solís"" [mailto:user@domain.com] Inviato: venerdì 25 luglio 2015 17:27A: Antonella Capaldo; Daniele MilanOggetto: Flight to Las Vegas Hi,I saw that 1st August there is also a AA95 Madrid New York (like the one I was about to take 3rd) and then AA45 from NY to Las Vegas to arrive there same day.Another one that take less time is AA741 to Philadelphia and then US676 that arrive just 45 minutes after previous option.Anyway, if there is the option, I would like you to choose a OneWorld alliance airline (American Airlines, Iberia, British Airways,...) to get advantage of the miles I´m going to do in this tripThanks a lot-- Sergio Rodriguez-Solís y GuerreroField Applicatio"
