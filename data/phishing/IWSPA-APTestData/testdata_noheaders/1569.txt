Madam Secretary –

First, wonderful job at tonight’s town hall!  As a follow up to this
morning’s email, here is a link to the two additional ads to air alongside
the .60 we shipped earlier: (1) a .30 and .60 version of “Children,” the
Droga5 spot about your lifelong commitment to children and (2) “Real
Progress,” the spot pulled from your closing argument on the stump.  The
press team would like to roll out the “Children” .60 early tomorrow am to
the press.

(Please ignore the “NFA” stamp on the Droga spot – the shipped version will
not have it)

pw: final

Thanks,

Oren
