User,

I wanted to see if you would have time to have a quick cup of coffee with a very good friend of mine?  His User is Michael LaRosa and he's Chris Matthews political producer on Hardball.  He got his start ten years ago as an intern in Hillary's finance shop and went on to work for Kelly Craighead at the Democracy Alliance before going to the Hill for a few years. He'd walk through fire for Hillary and would be a great hire on the campaign.  He's based in DC at the NBC News Bureau and would love to chat with you when you're in Washington.
