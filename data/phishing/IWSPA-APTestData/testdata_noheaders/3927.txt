Dear valued PayPal 
		member: 

Identity protection matters. And
		PayPal works day and night to help keep your identity 
		safe. That's why it has come to our attention that your PayPal 
		account information needs to be updated as part of our continuing 
		commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud 
		on our website. If you could take 5-10 minutes out of your online 
		experience and update your personal records you will not run into any 
		future problems with the online service.

However, failure to update your records 
		will result in account suspension.

Once you have updated your account 
		records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted 
		and will continue as normal.
To login to your PayPal 
		account and update your records click on the following link:

		Thank You for using PayPal!

The PayPal Team
