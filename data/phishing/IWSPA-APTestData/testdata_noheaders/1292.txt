Hey User,

Greetings from sunny and drought-stricken Nor Cal! Hope the entire user crew is doing well.

Just wanted to let you know that in addition to the Climate front, we are moving forward in a big way on three things:

1) Student Data Privacy (expect a major CA bill);

2) Kids and Teens Consumer Privacy (expect a serious CA bill);

3) ConnectEd/E-Rate 2.0 (LEAD Commission supporting POTUS and FCC effort).

Happy to fill in details whenever you have time.

Best from all Steyers,

Jim
