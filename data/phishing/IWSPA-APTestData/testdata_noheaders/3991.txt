Dear PayPal,

We recently noticed one or more
attempts to log in to your PayPal account
from a foreign IP address.

If you
recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in
attempts may have
been initiated by you. However, if you did not initiate
the log ins, please domain.com
PayPal as soon as possible to verify your
identity:

<>
cmd=_login-run

Verify your identity is
a security measure that will ensure that you are
the only person with access to the
account.

Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your
account.

Sincerely,
PayPal
