*Hillary Clinton to Return to Kentucky to Campaign Ahead of Tuesday Primary*

On Sunday, May 15, and Monday, May 16, Hillary Clinton will return to
Kentucky to campaign ahead of Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary. At
events, she will ask Kentuckians for their support and urge them to go out
and vote on Election Day. She will also discuss why she is the best
candidate to raise incomes for Kentucky families, to lower health care
costs and improve education, and to break down the barriers that hold too
many Americans back.

Additional details about this trip will be released soon.
