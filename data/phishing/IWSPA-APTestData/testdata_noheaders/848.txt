"Mr. Lynton,

Please find attached a brief Q&A; document ahead of your interviews with Japanese media in Tokyo, containing questions we received from the reporters in advance and our suggested responses. 

We have a short meeting scheduled with you following your arrival in Tokyo, so hope to go through this with you then, but if you have the chance to glance through it beforehand we would be most grateful. 

Thank you in advance,

George
