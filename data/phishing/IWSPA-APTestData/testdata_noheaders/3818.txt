Totally neglected common sense to invite friends to our table for the Rodale Institute's farm to table Organic Pioneer Awards dinner next Saturday in Kutztown, PA  so, on the off-chance you're free and feel like taking a drive it would be great fun to hang out. The new ExD of Slow Food USA and wife will be coming from Brooklyn as are our guests as well as daughter Savannah and friend from Penn and another MD couple from northern Westchester. If you can join us, would be a kick back night.
