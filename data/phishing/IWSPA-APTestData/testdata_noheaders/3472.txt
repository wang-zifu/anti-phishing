I like it, as long as the students feel safe getting involved. I imagine this demo will be nicer than the one in San Fran today.

If they are cool with it, I would have Casey go to the college newspaper and any other south bend publications and talk about college dem involvement in the protest and deliver some message hits - eliminate DOE, dangerous rhetoric, etc.
