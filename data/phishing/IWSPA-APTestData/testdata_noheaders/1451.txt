Hey Team,

With the bad weather tomorrow they are likely to just come to the Organizationand then go directly to the WH (skip the stop at ICE).  They will want to know what the Organizationis doing about these raids is my guess-both candidates have made statements to call to the end the raids.  Bernie has called for TPS, Hillary has not.  I know these groups have policy demands around this issue (these may be old, but hopefully helpful): <>+Recommendations+on+Central+Americans+seeking+refuge.pdf

User and Pablo it would be go to know what we can and cannot say about the raids in prep for tomorrow.
Thanks,
Bridgette
