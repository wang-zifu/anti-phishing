"Is Youth Really Watching Less TV? A Crane Perspective POV

Hi Amy,

Happy 2014!  Looks like all is well in your world!  Congratulations both on the very positive LA Times article this morning, as well as the historic success in award contenders.    

I'm looking for opportunities in movie and/or TV marketing.  As part of the campaign to promote my services, I'm starting a newsletter.  Attached is the first of what I anticipate will be monthly mailings with Perspective Insights on media, research, and marketing.  I hope you find the information useful, if you feel like you already get enough email, the information is not relevant or duplicative, and would like to be taken off this list, simply hit reply and type delete in the body of the email.  If, on the other hand, you could use some assistance in media, research or marketing, I'd love to work with you again.  

FYI, noting the comment on organization spending, I didn't do an update for 2015 and won't have all of 2015 for a few more weeks, but though"
