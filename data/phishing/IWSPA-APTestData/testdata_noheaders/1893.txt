Here's the draft:

"The forensic analysis conducted by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike confirmed that the DNC's initial findings, which were the basis of the temporary shutdown in December, were accurate. The domain.com confirmed that one campaign gained unauthorized access to the data of another, and four of its staffers conducted 25 searches using the other campaign's proprietary score data across 11 states. The domain.com further confirmed that the results of those searches were saved within the system, with one instance in which a statistical summary was exported. Following the conclusion of the domain.com, the Sanders campaign withdrew its domain.com."  - OrganizationCommunications Director User
