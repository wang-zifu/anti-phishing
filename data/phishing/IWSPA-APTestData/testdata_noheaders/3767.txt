"NewsletterDear a.mazzeo,I was very furious when I listened to your voicemail last night.You know, I didtell you about last month but you’re the one who was not interested inbuying at the time. It was trading for just 10 or 15 cents if I remembercorrectly. You cannot now blame me by saying I didn’t tell you.Anyway domain.com aside if you are still angry about missing the first wave I’mtelling you its not too late but you need to listen to me now and buy as manys.h.a.r.es of as you can on Monday morning before they get too expensive and ifyou don’t it’s your own fault I don’t want you calling me again and leaving meanother nasty voicemail.I spoke with my analyst buddy who is working on this specific stock-analysis andhe told me we should expect to see shares hit past a dollar within the next 30days. Do what you must.Take careYour budBeatrice"
