Attached please find a copy of chapter 7<<<link>>> of this year's Economic Report of the President (ERP). In recognition of CEA's 70th Anniversary this chapter examines the history of CEA and its role in economic policymaking. Former CEA chairs Laura Tyson, Christie Romer, Greg Mankiw, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Greenspan, and Martin Feldstein decided they missed writing the ERP and kindly agreed to contribute informative reflections on their time at CEA, for which we are grateful. The rest of this year's ERP will be released in the coming weeks.
