Mr. user - I just wanted to see if you could forward my photo to Hillary
? I'm a big Hillary fan. This is a one of a kind sports car in the world
because of the wings that I had installed on the doors. My Mother headed a
Hillary fan club in Fayetteville, Arkansas. My parents went to both of
Bill's inaugurations. I went to the organization of Arkansas and had Dianne
Blair as my Arkansas politics professor. My Mother and I will be supporting
Hillary in Kansas. Thank you, Sincerely, Larry Kellogg and Shirley Hines.
