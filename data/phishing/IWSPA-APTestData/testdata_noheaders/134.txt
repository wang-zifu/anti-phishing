"Reality production pioneers Cris Abrego and Charlie Corwin join the next installment of View from the Top

Dear Amy,

I am pleased to invite you to join us as The Atlantic's executive interview series ""View from the Top"" returns to Los Angeles on October 21 for a conversation with not one, but two entertainment executives—Endemol North America Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOs Cris Abrego and Charlie Corwin, in conversation with The Atlantic's Washington Editor-at-Large, Steve Clemons. 

Abrego and Corwin are reality television pioneers who founded the successful reality production companies 51 Minds and Original Media, both now subsidiaries of Endemol USA. Abrego’s 51 Minds has been a leader in the “celebreality” genre, producing VH1 series including “The Surreal Life” and “Flavor of Love,” and Corwin’s Original Media has produced the “Miami Ink” franchise for TLC, Discovery’s “Storm Chasers” and Bravo’s “The Rachel Zoe"
