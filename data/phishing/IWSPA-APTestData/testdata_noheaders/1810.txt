OMC Team,

  6 SOS,

  We have two RFIs that apply to both the FY14 and FY15 1206 AT-802 programs.

  For both programs, we are procuring helmets w/ oxygen masks for the pilots

  and the helmets coming small, medium, large, and extra-large. We'd like your

  feedback on how many of each size we should buy for a total of 8 x for the

  FY14 program and 15 x under the FY15 program. As you are all aware, we have

  the pilots identified for FY14 (attached), if that helps scope the

  recommendation.

  We are also obtaining combat survival vests for YAF pilots under the FY15

  AT-802 program - what color survival vests do the YAF wear currently? Is

  this the recommended color for the 30 x combat survival vests?

  I know it's the weekend over there today, but please let us know if you have

  any questions or need additional clarification on Monday.

  v/r,

  Allison
