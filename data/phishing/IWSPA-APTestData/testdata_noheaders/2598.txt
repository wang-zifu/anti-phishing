Hi User and Amanda-

Just confirmed with Mikulski's scheduling director that Mikulski will be
attending the Senate Caucus meeting with you. She is expecting to walk over
with you to the Capitol, so we don't have to worry about enlisting any of
Reid's staff. If Mikulski is running late or doesn't walk with you for some
reason they'll make sure that they have a staff person who can escort you
underground.

Reed Perry in Sen. Mikulski's office will meet you in Lot 19 when you
arrive. The best way to reach him or someone from the office is at
202-224-8862, in case you don't see him. If you let me know when you're
close I can also call to make sure that he's down there to greet you. I'm
858-395-1741, in case you don't have it, Amanda.

Best,
Milia
