The power of exec orders was always in the specifics of the good they did, only secondarily in the sense they showed action. 

If the message people are hearing is all in the ""concept of using them"",  it doesn't have the same appeal about getting real specific things done.

Ignore whatever is not helpful, but to me that encourages real people oriented exec orders.

Hope you are well and enjoying things, let me know if I can be helpful.

Admire what you are doing,
Tom
