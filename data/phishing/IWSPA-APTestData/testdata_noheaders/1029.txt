Members of the CGI Board of Advisors,

Now that I have spoken with each of you individually, I want to thank all of you more formally for having been members of the CGI Advisory Board over the years.  Your time and excellent advice has helped CGI grow into a recognized global brand and force for positive change in a remarkably short period of time.  With the re-merger of CGI into the Clinton Foundation no longer making the existence of a CGI board necessary, I appreciate your willingness to continue to be available for informal advice as we approach our tenth anniversary and continue to evolve in our second decade.

With gratitude,

Bob
