Trump Won't Announce VP Until Convention<<>>

Donald Trump is suggesting that he will User his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this July.

Speaking in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Trump said that it was still early in the process to select a running mate.

"It is early - we just won yesterday," Trump said. "I will announce it at the convention. A lot of people are interested."

Trump has not yet won the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination but now has a clear path to becoming the Republican standardbearer after his last two rivals, Ted Cruz and User Kasich, dropped out in recent days.

Trump also said that he would "do whatever the maximum standard is" in terms of separating his business interests from his role as president if he wins in November.
