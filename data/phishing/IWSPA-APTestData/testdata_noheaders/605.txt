"All, At the request of Tokyo Corporate Planning, we have edited the response to the first question on the Q&A list (# 1.01) – rather than referring to ‘economic weakness in India’ we mention the impact of the uncertainty in India in the run-up to the last general election.  Michael clearly spoke to this during our rehearsal on Thursday; we have simply updated the working document to reflect that. The updated Q&A document is attached here. Regards,Lauren. Lauren GlotzerCorporate Developmentorganization Pictures Entertainment +1 310 244 4725 (Tel)+1 310 244 0326 (Fax)user@domain.com domain.com"
