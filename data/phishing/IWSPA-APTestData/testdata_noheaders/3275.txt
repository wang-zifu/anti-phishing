Mr Userg:

I just watched you at the Oxford debate at
<<link>> with great interest in
spite of the horrible sound.  Can you find a better version to post?

You have a dynamite sound bite that you should use frequently.
Churchill, by not stopping the war when he could have done so cheaply
in 1940, caused the holocau$t.  It forced Germany into a corner.  You
should continually blame the Jews who controlled Churchill with
causing their own disaster.  Also blame the Jews for the loss of your
empire and the immigration invasion caused by it.  As Reichminister
Goebbles, of Blessed Memory, loved to say, "The Jews are to blame.".
