Good day,
Someone you know has shared a comment, thought, or suggestion with you using aSuggestion. You might like to know who posted the comment but, bear in mind, you may have never heard this feedback if the author was forced to share it directly. Take a moment, clear your mind, and appreciate this feedback for what it's worth.
When you're done with this suggestion, poke around and offer one of your own! Enjoy using the system.
