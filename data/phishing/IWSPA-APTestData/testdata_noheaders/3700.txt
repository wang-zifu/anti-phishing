Good day Kenneth/Vincent from the MFOi:

  During the Swiss Ambassador’s (Cairo) yesterday, the Defense Attaché mentioned he is now accredited to company, and interested in making a domain.com.

  Could you (in tandem with RSO) put him in-touch with a security escort company?

  Please advise and will send contact details, under separate cover.

  Many thanks and stay safe. cb
