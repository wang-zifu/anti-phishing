Dear User,

Last month, the EPA proposed new standards to significantly reduce natural gas leaks happening right now. This is a win-win for workers and the environment.

Tell the EPA now to support strong national methane standards that will reduce waste and support good jobs in communities across the United States. [ <<link>> ]

America could heat an estimated 6 million homes each year with the natural gas lost through leaks and outdated equipment and industrial practices. These leaks also contribute to climate change— pound for pound methane in natural gas is 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide.
