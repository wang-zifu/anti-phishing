User -- This is extremely important:

We're approaching the BIGGEST fundraising deadline of Anthony's campaign so far.

In less than two weeks, we'll file our fundraising numbers -- that means every dollar we've raised before October 1st will be made PUBLIC.

Make no mistake -- all eyes are on us to see if we can put up a strong number. So User, it's on us to put up a HUGE number that no one's expecting.

We're coming down to the wire and literally every dollar counts. Will you chip in today?

$5 >>	$35 >>
$50 >>	$100 >>
$250 >>	Other >>
Anthony has spent over 15 years working on behalf of the hardworking families across Maryland.

But if we want Anthony to continue fighting for us, we need your help User.
Can you rush a donation to our Maryland campaign today?
