Dear All,

With apologies for overburdening your inbox, I must clarify: the reading for the first faculty seminar on the Meaning of a Case, (wednesday, February 4th) led by Professor Brooks, is the ""Wolfman"" case in Freud's book, Three Case Histories.  That's the last of the three essays contained in the book.

Many thanks,

Robin
