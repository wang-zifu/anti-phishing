Sir,

  Additional information concerning COL Rosin’s questions:

  1.Is it possible to mount heavier weapons on the 87' patrol boats such as 20mm or higher?  It may be possible to mount a 25mm cannon (Mk 38) on the 87ft boats since the Mk 38 is an option for 110ft boats.  However, the largest I’ve seen thus far in my research is .50 cals on 87ft boats.  An RFI is out with the USCG rep for information on heavy armaments for the 87ft boats.

  2.Please refresh my memory on the milcon $1m for 5 each cg stations?  Sir, $1M was apportioned to each station totaling $5M.

  3.Can we procure 1 each defender per cg station in lieu of the rhibs? Yes, that is an option.  However, based on a previous LOA, the cost per boat would be between $360K-400K per boat. I’ve attached at word doc on the boats for reference purposes only.  Note: the price per 4.7M RHIB ($35K) is significantly lower than the estimated price for a defender class boat.

  4.I no
