Dear valued PayPal=AE member, 

Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following securi=
ty requirements.

It has come to our attion that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caus=
ed by members
using stolen domain.com cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we =
require our members to add a domain.com/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect y=
our account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your domain.com=
/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-=
10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will n=
ot run into any future problems with the PayPal=AE service. However=
, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension.

We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Fe=
deral regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, an=
d record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining=
 ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S.=
 banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons=
, PayPal=AE will utilize services provided by various domain.com report=
ing agencies to verify the information you domain.com to us.

Once you have updated your account records your pending PayPal=AE a=
ccount transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

To update your billing records please login to your account by clicking here.

Thank you for your time,

PayPal=AE Billing Department.
