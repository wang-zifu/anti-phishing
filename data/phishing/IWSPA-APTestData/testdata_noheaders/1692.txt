Dejuana,

I am not sure what you mean by "dedicated spaces." I hope you do not mean to suggest that I somehow stepped outside of my lane by reaching out to Virgie directly. 

I should have let you know that I spoke to her and, as I mentioned in my previous email, I will make sure that I loop you in going forward.

Also, I just checked my phone and I haven't saved your number. Would you please send it to me again. Much appreciated!

Cheers,
Deshundra
