Friend,

We're hours away from one of the last fundraising deadlines
of this campaign.

If you think the press and pundits are paying a lot of
attention to this race now, domain.com a few days. When everyone
comes back from their August vacations, all eyes will be on
this race -- and how the two campaigns measured up at this
crucial fundraising deadline.

We're just $5,446 from fully funding Terry's Rapid Response
Fund, and your donation could be the one that puts us over
the top.

Will you chip in $5 or more before midnight to make sure 
we show everyone exactly how much momentum is behind Terry 
and his vision for Virginia:
