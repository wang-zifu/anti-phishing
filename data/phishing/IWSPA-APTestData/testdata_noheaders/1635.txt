Hi Mr. user,

Hope you're well. If you remember, I was involved with the Big Data Report
and the student privacy legislation while you were at the White House.

But in the meantime, I would love to get involved in the campaign. Let me
know if there's any way you think I could be of help on technology and
economic policy areas or otherwise.

Thanks,
Dipayan
