Dear Colleagues,

I'm writing to let you know that I've decided to leave the Law Center. My last day in the office will be August 27.

Working at Georgetown Law has been a terrific experience, but after almost 12 years, I'm looking forward to new adventures and taking some time for myself.

I've greatly enjoyed working with all of you over the years and wish you my very best.

If you need anything, please contact the wonderful communications team at: user@domain.com

Fondly,

Elissa
