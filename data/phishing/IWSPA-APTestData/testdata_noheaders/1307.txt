It is time for the =91Stop Trump=92 movement to end. Yesterday=92s election=
 results show that the anti-Trump efforts didn=92t work.

Republicans now need to come together. Donald Trump is going to be our nomi=
nee, and he is going to be on the ballot as the Republican candidate for Pr=
esident. The Republican leaders in Washington did not choose him, but the R=
epublican voters across America did choose him. The voters have spoken.

If the anti-Trump groups don=92t stop now, their efforts will be nothing mo=
re than a contribution to the Clinton campaign.

The damage that President Obama has done to our country is serious and subs=
tantial. We cannot afford another four years of liberal incompetence, and t=
hat is exactly what Hillary Clinton would bring.

We=92ve had an extensive debate amongst ourselves, it is now time to get se=
rious about winning in November. This was a hard fought campaign, but now i=
s the time for Republicans to unite.
