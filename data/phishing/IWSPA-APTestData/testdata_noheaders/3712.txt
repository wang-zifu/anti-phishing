Georgetown organization Law Center is pleased to welcome Jennifer A. Hillman and Joost Pauwelyn as visiting professors, beginning fall semester 2014. Both will teach in the areas of trade and international law.

“Georgetown Law has long been the preeminent United States law school in the trade field, and the addition of Professors Hillman and Pauwelyn will deepen that extraordinary program. Professor Hillman has profoundly shaped the law as a jurist, public official and private practitioner, and Professor Pauwelyn is universally recognized as one of the leading trade scholars in the world. At a time in which trade issues are ever more important, we are delighted that both these leaders in the field will be with us,” said Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor.
