I get multiple freak out calls every morning and I try to talk everyone off the ledge and not bug u all.   But linda is in a different category.  She called this am and I talked her off the ledge but she did complain about not hearing from the campaign enough besides dennis.   I don't know that inviting to my thing this afternoon is a good idea, too many people in the room.  I think one of you needs to call her and go see her and walk through the state of things and the plan.  She feels like she is out there with her members pushing for HRC and holding against Joe and she needs more ammunition and attention.
