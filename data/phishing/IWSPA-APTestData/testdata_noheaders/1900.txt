"a unanimous vote

Friend – 

Yesterday, I joined my colleagues in the House in voting unanimously for reforms in the Veterans’ Affairs department that aim to improve accountability among VA officials and, most importantly, facilitate the delivery of medical care to veterans who live far from VA hospitals.

The recent revelations about the VA are outrageous and unacceptable, and I am committed to working relentlessly toward a solution for our deserving veterans. This bill is an important first step towards remedying the problems that our veterans have faced.

Now, it’s the Senate’s turn.

Will you join me in urging the Senate to take swift action on this reform as well?

Our veterans deserve better than months-long waits, and that’s why I won’t rest until we know that all of our veterans are getting the health care that they’ve earned and are entitled to."
