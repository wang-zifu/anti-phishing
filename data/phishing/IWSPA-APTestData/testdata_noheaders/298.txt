Art Meets Advertising Remixed

We warmly invite you to join Talenthouse at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.

High-brow meets populist? Commercial creativity meets ‘pure’ creativity? Two powerful creative worlds come together at The Forum on Thursday June 19th, which explores the relationships between art and advertising. Street art, filmmaking and fashion are regular features of advertising creativity, but there is a cross-pollination between trends in the art world, and those in advertising that can be an exciting source of creative inspiration for both.
