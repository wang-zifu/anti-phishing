Just want to flag that after they play a video of Trump saying terrible things and asked if those were addressed in the meeting, Reince says "there's a lot more that they (Trump and Ryan) agree on than disagree on"

Seemed like an odd answer given the fact that he just had to watch a 20 second montage of Trump being offensive.
