"22JS intl Update Sat a.m.

Australia:  about 75% reported and we look headed somewhere between$1.9MM - $2MM for Saturday.  No doubt who the winner is for the weekend as Train Your Dragon 2 not even beating us on Saturday (about 33% behind us) after we dominated Thursday and Friday. We will end up twice as big for the four days. They might throw in 2 full weekends of previews  for the press but theaters will know which film to give the seats and big screens to next week when vacations begin.  Glad they did it.   Great great position

Netherlands:  the power of the World Cup on display: comparing to last week's Friday when Holland played and the market was down, yesterday we are up over 300 percent with $155,000 and a cume passing $1.7MM and still #1.  We've got a long life left here (and seemingly everywhere)

UK Friday $865,000, down only 35% from last week, and World Cup over for them....all 3 signs point to great things for us.  We should cross $20MM today."
