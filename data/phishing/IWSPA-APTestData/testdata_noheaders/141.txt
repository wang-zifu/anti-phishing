"When one door closes, somewhere a window opens ~ The Sound of Music

I want to let you know that my last day at organization will be Friday, March 21.  If you had asked me in 1996 when I started as a temp in the TV Events department where I’d think I’d be 17 years later, I could have never imagined I’d be running the Motion Picture Special Events Department, travelling the world, meeting wonderful people and having exciting experiences all while working for organization.  It’s has been a fantastic company with terrific people and I have been truly blessed.  

I’m looking forward to turning the page to see what my next chapter looks like!
