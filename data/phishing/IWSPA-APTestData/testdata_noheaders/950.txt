User, Alex DeMarban from the Alaska Dispatch News is wondering if the chair=
woman or yourself would like to respond to criticism he has been hearing a =
lot at the convention that the chairwoman stacked the deck against Bernie a=
nd for Hillary Clinton.

I don't think he's particularly friendly, as he wrote this article: <>
domain.com/article/20160513/riled-sanders-fans-rise-state-democratic-conve=
ntion-begins I have no history with this reporter and he seems to have a di=
fficult time comprehending and recording information.

All the best,

Jake Hamburg
