For whatever it's worth, I feel like there's a decent chance that
citing Ruth Marcus to her will be counterproductive. She could easily
seize on that to say we're captive to Beltway groupthink (I hope
that's not true!) DMR is better as a proof point and if Anzo's comment
about voters is backed up by data, I imagine that would be helpful as
well.
