I think this is a great start, but think that we should spend some quality
time on this and get back together as a group to really push on whether
this captures her â€“ how we capture the depth of her work, etc..

So I would suggest that we gather again to talk through and spend more time
challenging whether this is the right concept to be in the middle of our
message box.
