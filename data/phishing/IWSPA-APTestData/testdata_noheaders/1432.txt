Hi Nick,

  OMC's FY15 program proposal will be submitted by Maj Matthew Vincent

  (cc'ed above).  The proposal is due to CENTCOM by 15 June. It is due to

  DoS by 1 Aug.  After that, there will be much coordination between key

  stakeholders (OMC, CENTCOM, DOS and OSD) to refine the proposal and seek

  approval.  That being said, if it is approved (no guarantees at this

  point), it would be placed in one of three tranches for congressional

  notification that range between anywhere between Dec 14 and summer 2015.

  Contracts would need to be solidified/implemented by 30 Sep 2015.

  That's the b
