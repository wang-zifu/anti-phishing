  received. The program is run weekly to ensure no one's inbox grows
  too large. If your inbox becomes too large, you will be unable to
  receive new email. Just before this message was sent, you had 18.
  Megabytes (MB) or more of messages stored in your inbox on your
  Webmail To help us re-set your SPACE on our database prior to
  maintain your INBOX, you must reply to this e-mail and enter your:

  You will continue to receive this warning message periodically,
  If your inbox size grows to 20 MB, then a program on Bates Webmail
  will move your oldest email to a folder in your home directory to
  ensure that you will continue to be able to receive in coming email.
  You will be notified by email that this has taken place. If your
  inbox grows to 25 MB, you will be unable to receive new email as
  it will be returned to the sender. After you read a message, it is
  best to REPLY and SAVE a copy.
