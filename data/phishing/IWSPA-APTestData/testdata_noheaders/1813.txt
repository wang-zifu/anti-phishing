Folks

HRC wants to have a meeting on Thursday at 10am in Chappaqua.  It will
likely last until 2pm or 3pm.  If you can coordinate your schedules
accordingly to be there that would be ideal.

In addition, Robby and User will do a pre-call -- likely on Monday
afternoon or evening depending on what is best for folks' schedules. There
also will be read-ahead materials shared on Tuesday.

Thanks
