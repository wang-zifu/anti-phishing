"   Hi - can we move the call back to 10:30am CT/11:30am ET? - NY/London are   asking for it to be a bit later as we have an emerging markets focused   call a bit earlier - please let me know ASAP - thanks!

Thank you both.  I may not be able to get you a formal   advertisement tonight (sounds like folks got out of dodge quickly after   today's action) - will try and get something over to you first thing in   the morning.       Marko - As we advertise tomorrow's call, can you think of a good   descriptive title that would best frame your discussion points?  I want to   make sure we're not advertising something that you're not going to   address!       Thanks again!   TB     -------------------",
