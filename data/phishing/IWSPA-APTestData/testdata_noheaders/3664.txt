Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful moms out there!
Every year a special day is dedicated to the women who raised us, wiped our tears (and butts), marched over to our 4th grade teachers demanding to know why her perfect child received a 'D' on the latest homework assignment, stayed up late taking temperatures and then was back at it again in the morning.

This special day is known as Monday - Sunday. In addition to the daily "thank you" we should be giving our moms, we should especially thank them on their only day off in the year: Mother's Day - and you know very well she's still going to make dinner and clean up after you then too.

Thanks, Mom!
