Dear Hannah, WJC asked recently for more information about CCI's work on EOR. Attached is the update we just received from CCI. As this is an area of work for CCI that we are just hearing about, we'd welcome the President's feedback and guidance. CCI says they have been ""working intensively"" on this in the US for the last 12 months in the Midwest and California,  and that someone Userd Brad Crabtree may have approached him about it in North Dakota last week. Thanks, Ami

""As additional FYI, our team also has been working with government and private sector bodies in the state of California to assess the potential for deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure in the state, building upon AB32 which mandates CO2 reductions and the recently-implemented cap & trade program.  As it Midwest, there is significant potential to utilize EOR for beneficial re-use of CO2.""
