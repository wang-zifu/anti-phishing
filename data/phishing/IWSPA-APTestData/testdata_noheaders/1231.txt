"a favor

Tina  - as you may know, Bobbie is out today.  Can I impose on you for a favor.  I see on my calendar that I have lunch with Jared tomorrow.  I’m still recovering from pneumonia so don’t think I’ll be able to keep the lunch (and although I don’t think I am contagious would hate to risk him being exposed).  It’s the second time I am rescheduling on him so thought if you wouldn’t mind calling on my behalf and letting him know that I do truly want to see him and am so sorry to have to reschedule again.  Thanks – much appreciated!  If you’d rather not, can you send me his contact info."
