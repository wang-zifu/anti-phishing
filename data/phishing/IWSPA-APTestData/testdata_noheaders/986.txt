Hey, it's Sean. I have some scary news: Not enough donors have stepped up, even with a poll saying our race is TIED. If we don't raise $6,900 to keep our ads on the air, CONGRESSWOMAN HAYWORTH WILL RETURN.

We only have four hours left before our deadline. It takes only 60 seconds. Here's the link: <<link>>,500,1000,2500,2600

This race is too close to call, and every dollar you give now will be on the air, fighting for us, tomorrow. I need you now more than ever.

- Sean

P.S. Happy Halloween!
