A MESSAGE FROM company BUSINESS SERVICES:

company is establishing a organization-wide Amazon Business account to facilitate all low-dollar and non-contract organization business purchases made on Amazon. While campus customers should always purchase from approved suppliers on the company eMarket, Amazon is a great resource for locating unique or specialized items not available from the organization's existing suppliers. company's Amazon Business program will go live for all Procurement Cardholders on Tuesday, February 13, 2018.  

The company Amazon Business account provides immediate access to:

Unlimited free two-day shipping on all qualified orders
Business pricing and quantity discounts on millions of items
Access to a specialized business-only customer service team 

Since this program offers the same shipping benefits as Amazon Primemembership, the organization will no longer authorize reimbursements ofAmazon Prime memberships. All Amazon-based business purchases must be made via the company Amazon Business account.

Please domain.com the company Amazon Business page on our Business Services website for more information on the program, and to review the action items that may be required of you, as an Amazon Business account holder.
