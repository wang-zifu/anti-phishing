Good Morning,

Below please find the media monitoring breakdown for Trump's foreign policy speech. We will begin at 11am and end at 3pm.
As Corinne mentioned in the morning meeting please take notes and flag tweets in real-time-monitoring. Remember we are looking for commentary about the foreign policy speech and not the state of the race. Good things to flag include national security and foreign policy experts saying Trump knows nothing about foreign policy. The goal is to catch good commentary to create a video reel as a response. If there is any good commentary about Paul Ryan please flag that as well.
