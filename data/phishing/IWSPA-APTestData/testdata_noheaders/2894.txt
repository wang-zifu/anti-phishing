Dear Colleagues,

GMS will be unavailable Saturday, November 15th from 2:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. in order to complete the conversion of Life to Date balances for Grants.

The outage is limited to GMS and does not impact the Georgetown network. The only impact for GU employees is that they will not be able to access GMS from any domain.com connection (GU or otherwise).

If you encounter any GMS issues, please contact the Service Center by emailing user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> or calling (202) 687-4949<<<link>>>.

Thank you for your attention.

Pim Thukral
