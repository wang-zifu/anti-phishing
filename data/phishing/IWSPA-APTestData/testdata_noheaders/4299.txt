Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking 
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically 
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue 
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw 
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your 
userUser or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification 
process. You must confirm your domain.com card details and your billing information 
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, 
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have 
updated your billing information on file.

To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link 
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

Thank you,
