We recently have determined that different computers have logged into 
your 
PayPal account, and multiple password failures
were present before the login. One of our Customer Service employees 
has 
already tryed to telephonically reach you. As our employee
did not manage to reach you, this email has been sent to your 
notice.

Therefore your account has been temporary suspended. We need you to 
confirm your identity in
order to regain full privileges of your account.

If this is not completed by September 24, 2005, we reserve 
the right to terminate all privileges of your account
indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank 
you for your cooperation in this manner.

To confirm your identity please follow the link below:

Thank you for your patience in this matter.
