Hi all,

Following up on our cross-departmental regional meetings, you will be putting together strategic plans with your counterparts in Communications and CE for each of the 18 battleground states. In order to do that, you will need to meet with your counterparts this week to talk through your states. You will receive a template for the plan tomorrow, so please schedule the meetings Wednesday through Friday. More guidance will come when you receive the template, but start by reaching out to your counterparts and getting meetings on the books. The hard deadline for these meetings is Friday COB.

Thanks,

Colby Moore
