"The NIE Report: Solving a Geopolitical Problem with Iran   Dr. Friedman;   Knowing the Administration's penchant for purposely misconstruing   intelligence for its own personal interest, I vote 20% intelligence   failure, 80% political redefinition.       Perhaps Rice has somewhat distanced herself from the ""bunker buddies"".       She is one of the few smart ones left and realizes that the American   people will not accept another Bay of Tonkin or WMDs.  Better to get the   truth out now and feel the pain than later!
