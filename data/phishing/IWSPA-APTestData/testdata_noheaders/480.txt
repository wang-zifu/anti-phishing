On behalf of George Yin:

Dear colleagues:

I just wanted to thank all of you for my delightful domain.com this past year. It was wonderful meeting so many of you and being part of your community. I had a splendid time. If you should find yourself down in Charlottesville, please let me know. And if you happen to need a good tax lawyer ... try Steve Cohen!

My best,
George
