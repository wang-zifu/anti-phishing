"A Trip to Minnesota   Maverick, Patti and I must spend three days at the treatment center in   Minnesota where Emily is currently residing as part of her therapy. Those   dates are Monday, April 18 (we actually go up on Sunday), through   Wednesday, April 21. I haven't made arrangements yet but will do so next   week. I hate to do this to you, particularly with the book push, but I   will work with Robert and get as much done on it as possible over the next   couple of weeks.   I must also attend Bethany's graduation at Amherst in May but will let you   know the exact dates when I have them.   -- Mike   --   Michael McCullar   Senior Editor, Special Projects   STRATFOR   E-mail: user@domain.com   Tel: 512.744.4307   Cell: 512.970.5425   Fax: 512.744.4334"
