Hi Judge Leon--

Papers are starting to come in!

User asked that I send you half of what has come in so far.  Would you
please take Greer and Aronchick?  Their papers are attached.

Right now he's grading Purcell and Lipsky.

Once we have a full list of the papers, I'll resend you ALL of your papers
in one batch email for continuity's sake.  Just wanted to send these too
you in case you wanted a jumpstart tonight.

Are there any you know already that you would want to grade?  If so, let us
know, and I'll put them in your folder.

Best to you,
Eryn
