"FW: user@domain.com has a new email address   If you just received this address change, please note that it is a change   of my HOME e-mail address. All business correspondence and communications   that you want me to receive during business hours should be still sent to   user@domain.com All e-mails sent to my business address automatically   are sent to my home address also. So if you send to my Lakemont address I   will receive it at both locations. Thank-you!       Paul H.
