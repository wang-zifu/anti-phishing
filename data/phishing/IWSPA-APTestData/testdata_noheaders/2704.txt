All,

The next dinner will be Wednesday, March 23.  Topic will be national security messaging and the 2015 elections.  Precise speaker lineup is TBD but we will have a polling discussion and hear from CAP on a new initiative they are launching in this area.

Please confirm if you can join on March 23.

Thanks,

Jacob
