So I've been arguing w various liberals on Twitter that at a time of high
inequality where the richest have most they have had in human history as
well as when we have a problem of demand, raising taxes on the middle class
makes little sense if you care about inequality in the country.

I was thinking I should write on this point. But would that be helpful with
current dynamics?
