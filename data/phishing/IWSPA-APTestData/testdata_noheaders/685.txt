  SANAA (Reuters) - company's government and Shi'ite Muslim Houthi rebels

  signed an agreement on Thursday to end a crisis that has seen weeks of

  sometimes bloody protests in the capital Sanaa, a member of the

  government's negotiating team said.

  Houthi protesters have been blocking the main road to Sanaa's airport

  and holding sit-ins for weeks at ministries in an attempt to oust the

  government and restore fuel subsidies.

  The negotiator told Reuters the agreement was signed by Sanaa's

  governor, Abdelqader Helal, and Houthi representative Hussein al-Ozzi,

  who is in charge of political affairs.

  The agreement includes a further reduction of fuel prices and the

  formation of a new government, the source added. He said he expected the

  Houthis to dismantle the protest tent sites after the new government is

  formed.
