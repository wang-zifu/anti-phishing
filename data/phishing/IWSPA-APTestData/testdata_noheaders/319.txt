Hi -
Attached is an excel for the "REQUIRED Fields for Surrogates."
Moving forward, to upload surrogates to the OrganizationSurrogate National List (the contact database) we need to have the data in this excel format.
Your teams got the excel in an email on Friday, 4/22.
Reach out with any questions.
Thanks.
