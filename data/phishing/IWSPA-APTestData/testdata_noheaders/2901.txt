What should I say to the Chair that's helpful? The truth is Leah ended the =
call on me yesterday when I told her about Face the Nation , and though I t=
ried, April avoided me in Philly. When she finally did call me at 6 she sai=
d she wouldn't come to asdc reception because she was headed to DC but that=
 she would let me know whatever was decided. Despite repeated emails, voice=
mails and texts, I never got a tic toc or anything from April to be able to=
 have any kind of exchange. I'm going to try to send this to April as a sug=
gestion, but don't want to drag the Chair into it. Any suggestions welcome.
