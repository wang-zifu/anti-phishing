Maura just told me that we are not where we need to be. We are running out of time to get $3,284 to the TV station or they will take my ads off the air at NOON! I need your help to close the gap.

This race is in a ""statistical dead heat."" Congresswoman Hayworth just infused it with a million dollars of her own money, and we can't waste any time. If we don't hit our goal, the only ads on the air will be filled with Nan Hayworth's radical Tea Party agenda.

I'm counting on you. Click here to contribute $250 to keep our ads on the air; without them, we won't win.

Thanks for having my back,
