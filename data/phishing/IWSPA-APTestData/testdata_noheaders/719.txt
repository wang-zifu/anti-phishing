As it stands, we will fail to hit our $1,OOO,OOO goal before tomorrow's end-of-month deadline.

We've been counting on a surge of grassroots support to put us over the top. But as of Xpm, we've fallen way behind.

If just 1 percent of the people reading this email donated $5, we'd hit our goal within the hour.

So if you're serious about getting corporate money out of politics, we need to hear from you today. Will you contribute immediately?
