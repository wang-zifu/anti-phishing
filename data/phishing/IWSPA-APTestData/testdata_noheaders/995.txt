All,

  With all the OD personnel settled down in Tampa and a changeover of a few of our folks.  I wanted to send the self-inspection checklist out to get a status of where everyone is on their current programs.  Please see attached checklist, additional duties list, and the breakdown below of what you are responsible for.

  Once you have completed your portion of the checklist, please save the file as â€œSelf_Inspection_PROGRAM User_Oct_14. If you have multiple programs, please save the checklist separately for each one and email back to me.

  If your appendix involved more than one person, please coordinate with the primary POC listed below and domain.com one checklist together.

  In addition to marking the status with the appropriate color-scheme, please put your initials in the box so I know who to go to if there are any specific questions in the future.

  If you have a program in the additional duties that is not on the checklist, please work with appr
