Hi User
I just heard for sure that you can't come until tomorrow morning.  I really appreciate how hard you are trying to come but would you prefer to just be on the phone?  It is a long way to go for basically an hour and a half.  Just let me know. We are good either way.  Very interesting meeting today at CAP.
