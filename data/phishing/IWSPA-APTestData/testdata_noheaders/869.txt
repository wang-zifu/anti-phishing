Madame Secretary and friends –

I got a briefing on the story, it’s in a much better place.  Takes the
viewpoint that 20 years after WJC declared “the era of big government is
over,” HRC is putting forward more liberal agenda that would expand
government’s role.  It refers to HRC’s “policy ideas” as opposed to
“plans,” notes she hasn’t rolled them out yet, and will do an economic
speech on Monday.  It says that if her ideas were enacted they would likely
cost in the “hundreds of billions of dollars,” does not put a number on it,
which is good.    There is a good bit in there about Bernie’s plans too,
and how he would represent a bigger expansion of government and questions
 whether HRC’s agenda will be seen as progressive enough in comparison.

It should post later tonight or tomorrow.
