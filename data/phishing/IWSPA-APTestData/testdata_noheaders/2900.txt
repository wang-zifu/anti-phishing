User,

Hope you're well. Have a favour to ask. We are publishing a Global Progress text when Trudeau visits in March -- will you make the lunch on March 11 - you should have received a board memo and Milia has dates too, I think. 

For the booklet, I have texts from TB, Lagos, Helle, Trudeau, Renzi, Gabriel, Lodewijk, Shorten and Store.

WJC has a draft text that's copy edited too, it is roughly the same text that was used in an Italian magazine feature he appeared in at the time of 15th anniversary of Florence conference. It's been copy edited, and Ami has signed it off. It's now waiting final approval from Tina, but we are fast approaching final deadline. Ami though if you dropped her a note, that might help ease the process along.

Anything you could do to help would be appreciated, but fully understand how busy you are.

Hope to see you soon.
