User – how can I help? 
I would like to be a part of the convention team, particularly as a  part 
of  WJC's activities.  If  my varied experience working conventions can be 
helpful (pdf below), I would  like to be an early participant in the planning 
and development of HRC Campaign  operations in Philly. 
I am, of course, available to help in any way I can … advance?  …southern 
organization?   
Please  pass this along as you think best.  Thanks, User.
