I am so pleased that you are advising the Obama transition effort.  He is in
good hands!

I will have Columbia College journalism students visiting the U.S.
Courthouse across the street from the Transition office tomorrow-Nov. 18th.
Do you have time to come down the elevator to say hello?  We will be there
at 9:00 a.m. and probably be wrapped up at 11:00 a.m.

If there is a chance, call me at home (708) 524-1349. .or on my cell phone
(708) 310-0618.

User, we need good people in Washington, D.C.  If Obama didn't win, I was
ready to leave the country.

Sincerely yours,

Rose Economou

P.S. I hope you and your family are well.
