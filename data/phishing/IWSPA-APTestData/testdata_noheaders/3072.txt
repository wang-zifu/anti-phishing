E. Devine   EDINBURGH organization   The rapid industrial development of the Scottish economy in the eighteenth   century had its economic base in the trade of tobacco, cotton, and sugar,   all crops produced on American and Caribbean plantations that relied on   slave labor.  But Scottish involvement went well beyond trade.  Many of   the plantations that produced these commodities were owned by wealthy   Scots.  The transformation of Scotland in the eighteenth century was   brought about in part because of the Scots' intimate connections with   transatlantic slave-based plantation economies.    T. E. Devine is the Sir William Fraser Professor",
