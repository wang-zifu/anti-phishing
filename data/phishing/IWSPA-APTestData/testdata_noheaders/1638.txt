If you expect me to see every single email that goes to you (Wendy did
leave me off that car email, so I didn't see it, and since I'm monitoring 6
separate emails, I'm bound to miss a thing or two) then I think we need a
different arrangement.  Instead of working two part time jobs, I'm now
working a full time *and *a part time job, which is pretty unsustainable
given that my third trimester starts next week.  I'm sure it will get
better as Milia gets settled--she's doing amazingly--but I'm not a
superhero.  I'm exhausted and you expect too much.  I'm still so grateful
about the CAP/EG arrangement, which is why I haven't said anything, but
it's not working at all in practice.  If I weren't pregnant, I really would
just suck it up, but this is just too much.

Would like to talk more about it Sunday.
