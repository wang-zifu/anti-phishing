You need to tell me what procedure for collection is .

Time is very precious now â€“ I am very busy so hope this is a quick job

You find a Paki corner shop with the black and yellow WESTERN UNION side
outside. Any one will do. Take photo ID, e.g. a paspsort. They will then hand
you the cash that has arrived in your User. domain.com until I notify you.

What's your cellphone number by the way? So I  can text you. Leaving here in an
hour for Columbia SC
