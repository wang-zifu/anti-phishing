High-achieving students from ten countries travelled to Israel this summer to study and research at the Davidson-ORT Science Summer School and the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Despite the security situation in Israel, 20 ORT teenagers from

Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Mexico, Panama, Russia, Ukraine,

and Israel came together for three weeks to pursue research projects under the

guidance of some of the world’s best scientists at the Davidson-World ORT

Science Summer School, held at the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot,

Israel), one of the world’s leading multidisciplinary research institutions.

These talented students went through a rigorous selection process and

had to demonstrate a particular combination of achievement, commitment, and

ability to be accepted into the program.

Meet the impressive students and learn about their projects.
