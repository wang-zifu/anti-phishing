Amy / Tracie --> Flagging that the meeting for the Chairwoman with Bob Saks=
 from the Friars  Club (follow up from the conversation with Mayor Dinkins =
at the Brooklyn, NY Debate with Amy) has been scheduled for 5/25 at 2:30pm =
EST at the Organizationin the Chairwoman's office.

Tracie --> who should write the briefing? I understand that User and Ryan s=
hould be in this meeting? It looks like it is going to be a request for the=
 nominee to speak at their annual event the week before election day so thi=
s would also fall under the purview of the political department
