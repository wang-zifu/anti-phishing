It's this week. Trump said he wants to punish women. There are senators, MoCs, state legislators all over the country who are doing just that.
Regionals - please work with state parties - especially battlegrounds - to get events, calls, etc. together hitting Trump, calling into question a SCOTUS nominee that will enact the trump agenda of 'punishing' women, hitting the House Rs for the planned parenthood investigation, and other anti-choice nonsense we are seeing in the states.

Thanks all.
