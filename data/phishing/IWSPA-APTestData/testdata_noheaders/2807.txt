Dear User 
Read your White House email.  Seems a long long time before China reaches its peak.
If there was an alternative that was not costly to implement, zero rated (completely) and probably up and running within 12 months, would anybody be interested or is it just business as usual.  
Nuclear will be the fuel of the future but until then, and the safety elements are put to rest, this may well be a 10 year stop-gap.
