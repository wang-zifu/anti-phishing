Hi User

Hope you're enjoying this holiday weekend.

I traveled to Alaska with President Obama last week and had the chance to
talk with him at length for up coming Rolling Stone story.  I'm working on
long introduction to interview that discusses his legacy on climate etc.
Do you have time for a phone call to discuss this?  My deadline is end of
day Thursday.

Best,

Jeff
