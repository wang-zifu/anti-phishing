Friend,

Today is the last day you can vote during the weekend. 

Early voting allows you to vote when it is most convenient and avoid potentially long lines at your Nov. 4th polling location. It also gives you a chance to correct any discrepancies you may have with voter identification.

Go vote today, and bring some neighbors.

VOTING IS FROM 1PM-5PM

Thank you,

Ed FitzGerald
