Our SuperPAC board currently consists of Harold Ickes, and Greg Speed from America Votes, and we have one vacancy.  I think a total of 7-10 is probably ideal.  Aside from our esteemed new co-chairs, we discussed the following as possible additions:

Stephanie Schriock 
Mayor Julian Castro

I am culling the list of speakers from the convention which may also provide some good, representative options.  Please think of people who would be good and send me suggestions by Monday.  I will compile suggestions and we can set a call to discuss options and dole out assignments.
