I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am
confident that they know that I am an effective advocate on their behalf in
Congress.  Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I remain,
as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the Presidential Democratic
primary and I look forward to working together with him for Democratic
victories in the fall.
