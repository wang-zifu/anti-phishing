Heads up that Mandy rejected our best and final offer today, which was
for $750,000 for the cycle, including a $150,000 win bonus.
I think she's expecting us to come with a counter offer but we are
going to tell her we are holding firm.  I wouldn't be surprised if she
calls either of you.
Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss the strategy
on this further.
