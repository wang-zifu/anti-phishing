"Let There Be a New Vision for the Future!

 The Centennial Campaign for UCLA. Together we can create tomorrow.     

 Let There Be a New Blue and Golden Era 

Earlier this month, thousands of us experienced a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we want to share it with you. We promise you will never look at Royce Hall the same way again.   

As part of the launch of The Centennial Campaign for UCLA, thousands gathered outside the organization's iconic building for an unforgettable light-and-sound show projected onto its facade.      

We invite you to view and share this amazing video with friends and family. And we hope you will be thrilled, as we were, by the dramatic story of nearly 100 years of UCLA dynamism and global impact�"
