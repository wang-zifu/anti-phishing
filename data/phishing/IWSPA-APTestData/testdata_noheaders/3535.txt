As follow-up to WJC's comments today to secretary chu at arpa-e, should we consider talking with suntech (since we know them via cgi) to gauge their appetite for (or their general view on) giving away or heavily discounting solar panels for deployment in africa? Could be a commitment at cgi in september, if they have interest. And would not put us crossways with State or DOE. I'd welcome your feedback. Thanks, Ami
