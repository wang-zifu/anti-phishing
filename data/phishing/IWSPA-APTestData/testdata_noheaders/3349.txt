Hi Judge Leon and User--

I called GULC to make sure your classroom AV capabilities and set up will
remain the same this semester, and that they won't make any changes to the
set up without informing you.  Your technician for Monday nights is:

Loren--202-662-9232

He's onsite every Monday night, so if there are any issues, please do call
him for help. I'm around today if you need anything prior to class.

Best,
Eryn
