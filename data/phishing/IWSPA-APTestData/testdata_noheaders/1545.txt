"A Warm December (1973) - Sydney Portier

Hey Michael

Awhile back you suggested I come up with an idea like Jumping the Broom.

While at the airport and ran into Wendall Pierce, an actor and homeboy, who has been in The Wire, Treme and other TV shows.

While talking about movies he mentioned how it would be great to remake A Warm December staring Idris Alba and Lupita Nyong. This would be really hot!  

If you like the idea and get the rights, I'd love to write it. Please let me know. 

Great hanging with you. 

Tim
