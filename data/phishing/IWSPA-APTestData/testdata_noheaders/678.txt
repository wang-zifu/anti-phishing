Dear Professor,

We will be in the area buying surplus textbooks this week. If you have any
that you would like to sell, please let us know the dates and times you will
be available and your location.

We purchase instructor's free copy (IE) We do not purchase ANNOTATED
INSTRUCTOR'S EDITION (AIE) 

If you would like to know if any of the books you have are good, you can
email or text me the ISBN that is located on the back of the book.

We would really appreciate your business and hope that you will contact us
if you have surplus textbooks.

Thanks,

Bill Hodges
