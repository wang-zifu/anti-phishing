Victoria and Jennifer will be ready to provide an update on Wednesday, November 23rd. User had said before he left for China he could come in person midday. My father is available after 12pm and I was waiting to hear back from User before reaching out to Bruce about his availability for a call - Bruce though now that we're on this chain, when are you available? Would 1-3 or 2-4 work? Or? 
Cheryl, Victoria told me you were not able to work out how to become covered under privilege. As such, she recommended our meeting and call be only my father, the Board and User. My father wants it to be Bruce, User, me and him.
Please advise and I'll also touch base with Victoria.
Thanks.
Chelsea
