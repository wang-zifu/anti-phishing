Still feeling really sick, and I know that with my cough and congestion I'll get sent home as soon as I go into the office again. So I'll work from home today. Now by working from home, I mean I will actually be working from home-so please send projects and things I can help with my way! I should be back from the doctor around 10:30/11.
