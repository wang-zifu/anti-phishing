User,

Just met with Holger Stark, Washington bureau of ""Der Spiegel"". He would be
interested in talking to you on background about transatlantic issues and
the overall mindset at the Clinton campaign. He just returned to DC after
spending a week in Europe with Jeb Bush (as only non-American journalist),
including a one on one in a beer garden and an interview-some interesting
take-aways.

Would you be interested?

M.
