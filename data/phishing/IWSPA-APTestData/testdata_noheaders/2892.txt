Rachel,

  The email from last night did not go out so there's no need to cancel it.=
 =20

  The only senders set to be allowed to send to user@domain.com are d=
user@domain.com and user@domain.com  Since Mark sent it as himself, the s=
ettings discarded the mail just as if someone on the list had directly emai=
led user@domain.com
