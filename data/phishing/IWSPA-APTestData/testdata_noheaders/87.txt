It's been about two years since I've been asked to be on FTN. What are the t=
opics? Is the primary purpose to have me on to continue the back and forth o=
ver the NV convention? Or to get me to respond to Weaver's allegations? I'm h=
appy to go on but only if it is a general discussion on the election, not pr=
imarily this controversy. Please let me know. Thanks. I would need to do thi=
s remotely from home.=20
