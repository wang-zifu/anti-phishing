Erik, thinking I'll send this to Bill. What do you think?

Hey Bill, we were in Alaska this weekend and she's in district today. She won't get a chance to respond just yet. Back in January when we added the extra four debates, the agreement was that they had to be a DNC-sanctioned debates, no weekends, so if you feel you have to move ahead with any letter without us it would just have to be clear that it's talking about a DNC-sanctioned debate and on a weeknight.

Beyond that we may not be able to chime in officially on this any time soon since we're having to work with the campaigns behind the scenes, we don't want to pressure them publicly.
