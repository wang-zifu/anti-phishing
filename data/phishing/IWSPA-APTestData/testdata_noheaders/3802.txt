Dear User,  the Italian NSA, Amb Armando Varricchio, will be in DC on Sept 11 pm and Sept 12.
He will meet Susan Rice on the 
12th at 2:30 p.m. at the WH.

Armando is, of course,  one of the closest collaborators to Italian PM Renzi, the young and dynamic Democratic Party leader. 

You may have already been told that Amb Varricchio would be delighted to be able to have a meeting with you.

I hope your agenda will allow this meeting to take place.
Looking forward to your kind reply,  my best personal regards.  Ciao!
Claudio
