I have two tickets in the 200 level for the game this Saturday night against the Raptors, who are a half game ahead of the Wizards for 2d place in the Eastern Conference.  Should eb a good game, but I cannot go.  Although face value for the pair is $80, I will sell the pair for $70, on account of the late date.  Any takers?
