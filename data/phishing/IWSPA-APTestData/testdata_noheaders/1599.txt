closing time of 9PM as needed. 

See if you can word it a certain way to those planning to attend that it would
be nice not to "lose" money for such a nice, supportive and discreet locale and
that they should have a steak and a glass of wine or two rather than a small
sandwich and a glass of water... perhaps you have other ideas along these lines
based on your experience in these events. We continue to learn and improve! 

So you are in Raleigh the evening prior, will you come up here Sat PM and spend
the night with us? It is under 3 hrs to our house, no problem if you come in
late, I make that trip all the time coming back from car auctions. 

I am off to Hilton Head SC tomorrow through Sunday for a Concours d'Elegance and
a couple meetings, expect I'll be back no later than mid-day Monday, still
hopeful for Sunday night. This e-mail address goes to my Blackberry as does the
phone beneath, call or e-mail as needed.
