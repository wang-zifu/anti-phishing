I had the same experience today with Bank of America Visa. The request was for all sorts of personal info which BoA Visa already had.   I also called and was told that it was not domain.com.

I just received an email from Marriott Rewards asking me to update my phone number and email address as part of a security upgrade. The email looked genuine, but I was nevertheless suspicious enough to call Marriott to ask if it was legitimate. They told me that it was not. So if you get such an email, I would advise against clicking anything.
