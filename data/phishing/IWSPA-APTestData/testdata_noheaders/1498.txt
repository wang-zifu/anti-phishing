Capt McVann,

  I'm just writing to say ""Welcome Aboard"" and to introduce myself.  I'm the FMS Case Manager for the Building Partner Capacity cases that NAVAIR manages that don't belong to one of our program of record program offices.  We currently have company CN-235 follow on support case H4-P-GAC (expired but not completely delivered), and Light Observation Aircraft (LOA) cases H8-P-SAC and J1-P-GAB.  The J1 case is follow on support to the expired H8 case which contracted for 12 of the LOAs with deliveries, training and FSR support in calendar year 2015.  Kevin Holland is the Technical Point of Contact for the cases and he is cc'd.  Kevin manages contract and technical execution but is not an FMS Case Manager.  My primary responsibility is completing any necessary FMS paperwork or documentation and ensuring that the case is executed within FMS and 1206 guidelines.  Also cc'd is Kate McMinn, our BFM.

  I'm sure that MAJ Vincent will be providing you a pass down of all the challenges
