It'd be interesting to look at labor and business regulations     in the Philippines to tackle this issue. I have Mexico in mind when     thinking about the philippines, so I'm guessing that if there are     similarities between both cases then an important cause of unemployment     may be rigid labor, tax or business regulations that hamper     enterpreneurial activity in the country, making it dependend on FDI that     is reluctant to flow into the country due to security issues (MILF),     shoddy infrastructure or what not. -- Jose Mora ADP STRATFOR 221 W. 6th Street, Suite 400 Austin, TX 78701 M: +1 512 701 5832 domain.com",
