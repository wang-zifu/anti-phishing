I think this is good-- especially the last paragraph.

2 things:

1. The sentence:"According to Politico, Jewish leaders on both sides of the=
 aisle were dismayed by Trump=92s refusal to combat"
Is there suppose to be something at the end of that sentence? Maybe anti-se=
mitism?

2. Want to call everyone attention to the article below because:
A. Some of these groups may be hesitant to issue this statement with us for=
 the reasons articulated (but I think we should try)
B. JCPA is also not on our list and I think we may need to reach out
