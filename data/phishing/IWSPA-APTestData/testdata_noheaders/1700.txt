Hi User -- It was great to see you in SF last week.  Seems like a very
exciting start for the campaign.

We are writing to let you know that Nat Simons plans to be in DC next
Monday, April 27, and he was wondering if you might have some time to
meet.  Very sorry for the short notice, but we only learned about Nat's
travel plans a little while ago.

We thought you might share with Nat some of the comments you made last
week, as well as anything else you or he would like to discuss.

Please let us know if you any availability.  Nat should be free from 9 to
10 and from 11 to 3:30. Hopefully one of those windows would work for you.

All the best,

Bill and Kathleen
