Dear User,

Great to see you yesterday. Sorry I could not stay—Trade, leadership, COOL. I
am looking forward to an opportunity to sit and speak about issues sometime
soon.
I have forwarded you a resume for Kelly Dittmar, a former employee—who
would like to be involved in the Secretary’s campaign. Kelly is a Star. She
just authored a book—Navigating Gendered Terrain. Thanks for your
willingness to get this to the right place.
Love,
Rosa
