Dear User,

I will have 40 women in the city the week after next for a Rachel's
Network gathering and wondered if you might have the time and interest
to speak to them over lunch on March 24th at a private room at the Old
Ebbitt Grill, owned by one of our members, Sally Davidson?  I've
attached a letter with details and brief description of our group for
your information.  Thanks for taking the time to consider my request.
This appears to be a personal email address that LCV has on file for
you.  Hope it is the appropriate contact to be using.  We miss you at
LCV!
