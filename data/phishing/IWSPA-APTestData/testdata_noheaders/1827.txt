The world is out to get me on this trip

1) it couldn't be a worse and more visible time for me to be away from work

2) I spent 105k miles for this ridic ticket (55 extra to fly back to DC)

3) hats didn't come 

4) it's now supposed to rain most of the week...even though it basically rains there never
