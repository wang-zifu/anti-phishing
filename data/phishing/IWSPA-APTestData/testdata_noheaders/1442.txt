To all of our Friends, Coworkers, and Fellow Travelers:

In a long tradition of mysterious and baffling behavior, the US Postal Service has not determined that our official address is 498 Sea Cliff Avenue, not 496 Sea Cliff Avenue. They have committed only to deliver mail addressed to the new, correct address. Rather than trying to change the will of Zeus, please use the ""498"" address and make the Post Office General a happy and contented civil servant.

Thank you,
Tom Steyer and Kat Taylor
