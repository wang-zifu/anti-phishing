Many members of the Law Center community have reported slow network connections and problems connecting to their Georgetown Google Apps for Education (GAE) accounts.  Google is in the process of an upgrade, which is causing their services to periodically drop. This affects not only the GAE email system used by students, but other web connections, such as Gmail-web, YouTube, Google Drive, etc.

For those community members using Chrome, please close and re-open it. This will re-establish your connection to Google's services.

Gmail accounts (including GAE email) that connect through mobile phones (IMAP) do not seem to be affected.

We will keep you informed as we receive more updates.
