Hi User, I hope you had a great Christmas.  We wanted to share with you this long book of policy memos that we gave to HRC for vacation reading.  As noted in the cover memo, this reflects months of work by a team of about a dozen volunteers who conducted more than 100 interviews with thought leaders in a wide range of fields. These are not ""decision memos"" with definitive recommendations; instead, for this first tranche we've tried to provide the contours of an agenda and a sense of some of the big ideas, with more to come in January.   Would love your thoughts and reactions to any and all of it - especially the climate change paper from Pete, Trevor, and Ben.
Thanks
Dan
