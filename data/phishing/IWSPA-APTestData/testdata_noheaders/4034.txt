Attention ABSA Bank Customer,

Due to the new Advanced Online fraud going into circulation, ABSA Bank has developed an Online Security Program (SentryBay) to protect our customers from fraudulent activities and online phishing.

It is highly recommended that you download the attached security page and follow the instructions for this program to be active on your account.

As a result of this online activation program, you are required to bear with us online for some minutes and please follow our instructions as your account verification continues.

It is highly recommended that you follow these instructions as ABSA will not be held liable for any fraudulent activities in your account.

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience this action may have caused.

Regards

Online Security Department
ABSA Bank
