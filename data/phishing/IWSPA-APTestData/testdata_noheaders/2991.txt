Multiple media (8/12-13) reported that clashes have intensified between

  Houthi militants and tribesmen in al-Ghail District of Al-Jawf

  Governorate. Twenty Houthi militants and five tribesmen were killed in

  these clashes. Reports mentioned that armed Houthis had destroyed the

  district's Security Directorate and controlled the governmental main

  complex. Sources said that the presidential mediation committee

  overlooking the implementation of the provisions of the cease-fire

  agreement that was signed by both parties has failed in its mission and

  that the Amran Governorate scenario is going to be repeated in Al-Ghail

  District.
