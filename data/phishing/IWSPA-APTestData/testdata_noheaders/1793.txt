Dear all,

Please note the company we keep in this ranking
<<<link>>>,
one  of which we can be justifiably proud. The magazine describes its
ranking in this way:

 ""We rate schools based on their contribution to the public good in three
broad categories: Social Mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income
students), Research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and
Service (encouraging students to give something back to their country).""

Thanks to you for all you do to make this recognition possible.

Teresa
