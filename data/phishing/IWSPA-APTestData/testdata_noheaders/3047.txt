SL: Video TBT: That Time President Obama Clowned Trump at the White House Correspondent's Dinner

Relive the glory:

"Five years ago, President Obama exposed Donald Trump as a clueless fraud. Trump's foreign policy address yesterday showed that the GOP frontrunner is no more qualified for the presidency today than he was when he was negotiating disputes between Lil' User, Meatloaf, and Gary Busey on Celebrity Apprentice."

"All kidding aside, Trump would be an unmitigated disaster as commander-in-chief. His plan to bring back torture, ban Muslims from the United States, deport immigrant families, pull out of NATO, and end foreign aid to Israel is no laughing matter. Americans should be alarmed that a man like Donald Trump has a real shot to capture the presidency, and Democrats will do everything in our power to make sure this dangerous individual is not given the keys to the White House." - Spox
