"Friend --

	Before I head out for the day, I wanted to let you know how much we've accomplished. We started the day in a tight spot with our GOTV budget. Because of your help we are now fully funded through Friday!

	But there isn't a moment to celebrate. The last four days are the most important, so we need the funds in ASAP to make sure we can put forth our strongest efforts on all of those days as well. Chip in now to help us. This is urgent:Â <<link>>

	Together we'll win this!

	Anthony
