Hi all -- here's a draft of tomorrow's remarks at the women's economic
opportunity domain.com in Manchester.

She's supposed to speak for 10 minutes or so at a podium, then have a
moderated Q and A.

I've included a few paragraphs on today's shooting at the start.

I'm sending to the book now so please send any edits anytime tonight.

Thanks!
