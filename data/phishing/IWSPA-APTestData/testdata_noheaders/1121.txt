"GRAPHICS REQUEST - Afghanistan/MIL - A Week in the War - med length - 11:30am CT - 2 maps   Standard map:     * Helmand and Kandahar highlighted and labeled.     * Sangin (Helmand) and Zhari (Kandahar) districts highlighted.     * Marjah marked.   Also need this modified:   <<<link>>>   just need to drop Helmand in the locator map. If we can drop the other   provincial borders, that's great but no biggie.   Thx.   --   Nathan Hughes   Director   Military Analysis   STRATFOR   domain.com"
