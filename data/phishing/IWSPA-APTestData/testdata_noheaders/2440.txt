It was great to see you both this weekend. Thanks for hosting me for the dinner, I appreciated the opportunity but was especially glad to catch up with your teams in the pre-reception. As I mentioned, the Chair will be in New York tomorrow, and we wanted to see about having her meet with Phil to touch base including on the town hall. We also wanted to see whether Mika was either free to join or maybe meet with the Chair before or after. Let me know if we can make that work. 10am is ideal, if possible.

Hope you both had the chance to get some rest after the hectic weekend! - User.
