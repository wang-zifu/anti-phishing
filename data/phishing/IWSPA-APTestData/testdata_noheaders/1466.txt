""With the Pennsylvania primaries taking place in just eight days, Barack Obama now finds himself on the defensive,"" reports Jose Delgado for El Nuevo Dia. ""Comments made last week during a fundraising event in San Francisco are now haunting him..."" he adds. Delgado adds that both Senators Clinton and McCain denounced Obama's comments during the weekend...-- ""Senator Obama's comments are elitist and out of touch,"" said Clinton.
