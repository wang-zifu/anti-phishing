"quite a year

Friend,

2013 was quite a year, and your help ensured we ended the year right. Thanks to you, we beat our end of year fundraising goal, and we’re starting the election year off in a strong position. Your support means so much to me.

Over the last year, I’ve been working hard to serve Southern California. As you might remember, I recently wrote a letter to House leadership calling for the restoration of nutrition assistance cuts, to prevent our most vulnerable neighbors from going hungry this winter.

I’m proud of my work to ensure that taxes already collected for our ports are spent at the ports, and helping to connect our community's small businesses to the ports. As 2015 begins, I will continue to advocate for solutions to help our small business prosper, and to ensure our hard-working families have the opportunity to thrive, including working to restore unemployment benefits that have recently ended.

We've got a lot we need to accomplish in 2014, so I want to keep you up to dat"
