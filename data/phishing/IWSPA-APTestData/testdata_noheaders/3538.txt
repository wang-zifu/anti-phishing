Jay,

  I would definitely like to pick your brain on this in the near future.  Particularly, I'd like to see how analogous what you're working in Jordan is with what we envision for company.  The equipment and training points too are currently key topics among the community for our program.  If there are better times of day than others to reach you, please let me know what's best.
