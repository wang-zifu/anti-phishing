User,

Thank you so much for hosting and cooking last night.  I know it was a big,
heavy, inconvenient lift and that you did it out of love and loyalty.  It
was fabulous.  You are so amazing.  Unflappable in life and in the kitchen.

So many people came out last night for you.  Most of us got brought into
team Leahy by you and for you.  Some, like me, have never left.

I am always grateful to you.

And with everything else you are working on â€“ GODSPEED!

XOXO

Tina
