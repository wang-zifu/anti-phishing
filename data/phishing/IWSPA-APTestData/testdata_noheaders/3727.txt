   FRIDAY: Judge Leon got back to me today--he has an immovable 9 am on
   Friday, so wants to know if you can come to chambers at 10:30 am (or
   call if you prefer).  He believes only 30 mins is necessary.  I said I'd
   block 10:30 - 11:30 am and will be available if you both want to call me
   with the grades, or I can come in person.

   *GRADES WEBSITE*: Password works.  Like most years, most students are on
   JD roster, and one due Friday is on the LLM roster.

   RYAN STAFFORD: Eryn is checking with registrar to see if he actually
   dropped the course.  He was not on track to graduate in the spring so we
   werenâ€™t anticipating his paper anyway.  His User is showing up in the
   roster AND on the grades website.
