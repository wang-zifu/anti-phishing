Hey User,

Hope that you, Mary and the far flung user gang are having a very good summer!

I assume that you will be up on Tahoe at some point soon in August... so I'd love to catch up and chat briefly. 

I'm actually in Hawaii and LA this coming week (rough life), but I'm back the entire following week, and it would be great to find some time to catch up... And maybe even see you in person if schedules domain.com.

In the meantime, please give our warmest regards to Mary and your whole brood, and all Steyers send their best to the user crew. Cheers,

Jim
