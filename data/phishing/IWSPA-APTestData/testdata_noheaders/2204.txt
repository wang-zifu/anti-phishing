Madam Chair, Nice job on Bloomberg, I thought you handled Nicole's rapid fire well. And the redirect on Nicole by telling her Trump would be a nightmare, not a fantasy, was great. Just please remember to never repeat a negative question, at the beginning when Heilemann said "Why is Berne Sanders wrong" it would have been better to not repeat "Bernie Sanders is wrong." It was good at the end that you pointed out we welcomed him and glad he ran as a Democrat.

I do think we can be clearer on the question about open primaries by just keeping it simple: "It makes sense that voters who are registered as Democrats get to select their Party's nominee. That's the nature of primaries. Of course the decision on whether to have open or closed primaries is a decision made by state government officials, not by the party.
