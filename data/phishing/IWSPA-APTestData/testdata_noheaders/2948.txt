Sir,

I wanted to let you know I spoke with Dennis and Robby today and told them
that unfortunately I don't think I can do the campaign at this time.

I promise this was not an easy decision, and one I imagine will come with
great regrets down the road.  Unfortunately, it is just not the right time
for the family and where I am to take this on.

I sincerely hope this does not come across as anyway ungrateful to you for
the opportunities you have provided.  Mollye and I are so thankful for all
you have done, and continue to do for us. The last thing I would want is for
you to think I don't  deeply appreciate your generosity, and willingness to
help me.

I did ask them to lean on me heavy out here for whatever I can do. I can
still be, and very much want to be, engaged in the campaign as a supporter,
fundraiser, etc. I'll do what asked.

Thank you again for all, and hope you understand.

Very Respectfully,
Josh
