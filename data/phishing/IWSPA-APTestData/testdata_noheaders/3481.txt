Dear Georgetown Law Center Community:

We would like to invite you to join us tomorrow in wishing a fond farewell to Rev. Kevin Wright who will be leaving us to become Director of Christian Education at the Riverside Church in Manhattan.  Kevin has contributed enormously to the work of our office in efforts to reach out to students of all faiths and of none.
Needless to say we will miss him a lot.

Please help us show our appreciation and gratitude by joining us for light refreshments from 2:00 to 3:00 in the Campus Ministry Office (McDonough 113).

Sincerely,

Fr. Paul Rourke, S.J.
