"A Century of Lawyers in the Family

Michael,

As I might have told you already, Jonathan Martin (on leave from Miami Dolphins football team) was admitted to the Harvard College Class of 2012, but chose to attend Stanford.  Although he didn’t join us in Cambridge, his family history is most fascinating.  There have been lawyers in every generation going back more than a century and he has entertained the thought of attending law school after his playing days are over.

I think the following brief account of his family history is interesting:

Jonathan Martin's parents:

          Clarence Augustus Martin (Harvard College '78), Lawyer

          Jane Howard Martin (Harvard College '79, Harvard Law School ’82), Lawyer

His maternal grandparents:

          Elizabeth Fitzgerald Howard (Radcliffe '48), Prof. of Library Science

          Lawrence C. Howard (Harvard organization PhD ’56), Prof. and Dean, Univ. of Pittsburgh

His maternal granduncles:"
