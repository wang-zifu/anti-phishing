"Dec 1 DGA Q&A

Hello, everyone. Today we screened primarily for the DGA Membership but we also had WGA, AMPAS, guild and some SAG Nom Comm in attendance, too.

Taylor Hackford moderated the conversation and the room gave David a very warm reception with strong applause when he was introduced. They discussed the heart of the story and the trilogy of storytelling, the development of the screenplay, the geniusÂ  opening scene and the filmmaking techniques.

Taylor complimented him on the magic of shooting and storytelling without using visual effects - the telephone call with Bradley and Amy in curlers and the process of the seductive smell of the nail polish, too. They talked about the metaphors and identity with the characters.

Taylor also talked with David about the time period set music choices and wonderful casting. 

It was an awesome Q&A because David and Taylor connected very well. The support and praise for David's work was evident and showed in Taylor's enthusiasm. It went so well that"
