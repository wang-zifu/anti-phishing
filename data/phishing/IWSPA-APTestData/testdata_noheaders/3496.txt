Hi guys

I wanted to share with you the total number of shifts confirmed today from
labor for GOTC and Caucus Day.  The majority of these shifts are over
Saturday and Sunday.  Labor has signed up and we are tracking locations for
1,854 shifts across the state of Iowa this weekend.  I estimate that 1,854
shift is 55,620 door knocks this weekend from labor. This is a huge number
and does not include the member to member canvasses and phoning they are
doing on behalf of the campaign.

We are supported by Presidents Mary Kay Henry, Terry O'Sullivan, Randi
Weingarten and Lee Saunders just this weekend.  Other Presidents having
coming in earlier, UBC, Ironworkers, AFGE, NTEU.

Big totals for shifts this weekend:
AFSCME  421
ISEA  324
SEIU 220
Other unions walking UA, UBC, LIUNA, Insulators, OPCMIA and BAC.
