For the record, I think you should make it clear on the registration page that
anyone who does not fill out the required fields risks having their reservation
canceled. It makes it very difficult for me to do reliable checks when I only
have a User or partial User or a city and no street address. Phone numbers and
emails are less important because I can't usually match those to a User.
Anyway...

Fred Douglas- NO. Not paid, no address or phone number.

Raymond E Peters- MAYBE. Cannot confirm. Please phone. Misspelled User of his
own city. Ask what his interest is, how he found out, etc.

D Mark O- MAYBE. Insufficient details. Has paid. Phone, ask questions. If phone
or email is a dud, then NO.

Randall De La Vega- Probably okay. Confirmed User and address. Middle aged male,
wife is Dawn.

Rodriguez- NO. Phoned, did not register, did not give any personal details. If
phones again, blow him off. Had plenty of time to register properly and said he
would, but did not.

Alan Rogers- Probably okay. Says friend of Bobby Ammon's. Check with Bobby? If
yes, then okay.

Richard Cox- Probably okay. Phone and ask for the Users of his guests.
