"Just to formalize a bit   Hi Todd -       Just wanted to formalize the conversation a bit - we discussed that Marko   would present the Greek Crisis at 10:00 CST and the fee would be $2,500.    I have reserved the time on STRATFOR's calendar and we look forward to   seeing your marketing invitation when you send it out to advertise the   call!       Thanks,   Debora       Debora E.
