Hi User --

Thank you again for Monday -- from pre-reception, to the main event, to
sticking around after to further engage with folks. Your earnestness came
shining through, which is a huge asset to Hillary's campaign.

Just heard your voicemail - thank you, and of course, you're welcome. Yes,
happy to get together next time you're in NorCal or we're otherwise in the
same town.   Also, if you'd like to debrief on Monday's event, happy to do
that. I have my own observations, as well as those of about a dozen folks
who have reached out to me.

And, of course, if there are other ways my expertise can be useful to
Hillary's campaign (eg., policy, GC (legal), messaging), please do let me
know.

Hope your trip to China was/is going well.

Best,
Erika
