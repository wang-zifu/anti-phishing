Per our earlier discussion about having the spokesperson for the
transition be someone who won't be WH spokesperson or someone visibly
considered for senior EOP jobs, wanted to get your recommendations - you
had mentioned PJ Crowley at one point.  I don't know him - does it make
sense for me to try to catch up with him on Wednesday when I'm in dC?
Is there someone else I should meet with?

Thanks
