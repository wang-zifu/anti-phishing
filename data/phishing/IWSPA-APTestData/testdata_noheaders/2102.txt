A friendly reminder to send your gift by June 30 if you have not already
done so...

Dear Trustees,

At the June Knox College Board of Trustees meeting, the Board chose to
honor Teresa Amott's leadership of the College with a one-time bonus paid
by trustees. It was requested that each trustee consider a gift of $500 or
more. Gifts are to be made to Knox College with President on the memo line
of a check or in the comment box of an online gift. It would be wonderful
to receive these gifts by June 30. This gift is over and above other
commitments you may have with the College for fiscal year end.

Thanks for your support of this effort to honor the wonderful leadership
President Amott is providing to Knox.
