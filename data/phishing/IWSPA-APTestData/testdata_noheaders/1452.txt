Gentlemen, when the Clintons suddenly emerge with a televised photo op at church
when her poll numbers are down, and this is broadcast on television news alongside
the latest that the Clinton emails may not have been wiped, it does not make television
viewers regard HRC as a woman of faith at church, it makes her look like an insincere
politician going to church when her poll numbers are down.  And a new television ad
about grandma will fare no better than the last television ad about mom.

There is a complete misunderstanding by the campaign of the nature and gravity
of her problems, and these things make her problem worse, at a time when she is in
a very dangerous and precarious position of high and growing distrust.

This is a very hard, and possibly impossible, campaign to help.  The solutions are
clear but the campaign has eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, to use
a phrase the Clintons hopefully heard in church today,    Brent
