Dear Fellow Trustees - 

Attached please find an updated cultivation list from Bev Holmes which has more detailed information than the document I sent this earlier this week.  I look forward to speaking with many of you on Monday during our webinar meeting.

Please note that you should plan a few extra minutes to get on the call since you will need to follow the instructions for downloading Citrix so you can see the screen.  Also, do not mute yourself using your keypad on your computer as you will not be able to hear the call.  There is a mute button in the application (next to your User, it's the green microphone button).  We'll explain as well once people are on the call.

Thanks to a number of you who have already ""claimed"" a few of the folks on the cultivation list!!

Have a great weekend.

Veritas,
Sue
