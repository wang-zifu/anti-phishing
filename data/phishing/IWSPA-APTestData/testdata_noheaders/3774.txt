"a little more good news

Don't want to bombard but some more good news is that he has been off 

the blood pressure medicine all day (I did not know that before).  AND 

he has very little oxygen.  These are all really good signs and if all 

goes well, probably Saturday they will move him to a regular room.

Had to let you all know...

Much love,

andrea"
