User-
Truly appreciate you making the effort to come to my office and listen to my thoughts. I look forward to meeting the Secretary and getting this back on track in a productive way for all. I can see why President Obama and Secretary Clinton see you as a trusted advisor, you are someone to aspire to.
Best,
RW
