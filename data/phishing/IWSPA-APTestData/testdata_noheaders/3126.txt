Homar,

  I doubt you'll get productive training done past 1100, maybe 1130 tops, particularly considering the need for focus in aviation training.  I am still waiting for CENTCOM to load my files from discs I provided them, so I can't yet see what clues might be in the archives, but it could be valuable to explore how training was scheduled/impacted for the C-208s upon delivery as Ramadan/Eid should also have fallen during that timeline.  I can also try to reach Col Abdulmalik, our principal YAF POC, for additional insight.

  V/r,

  Maj Matthew R. Vincent
