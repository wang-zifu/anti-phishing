We are glad that the court is hearing this matter tonight.  We hope that it
is resolved and the Sanders campaign has access to their voter files right
away, with adequate protections of our proprietary information, which we
understand could be completed in short order.  We also want a full
accounting of the Sanders campaign's actions and assurance that no data or
strategic insight from this breach be used by the campaign.  This was an
egregious breach of data and ethics and we hope that the Sanders campaign
comes forward quickly with an accounting of their actions.
