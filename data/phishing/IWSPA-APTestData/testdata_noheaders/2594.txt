"Question from a new subscriber   Have you ever done an analysis regarding UFO's and the alleged cover up   conspiracy?       I have been interested in this topic for quite some time, but it is so   hard to separate out the loonies from the potential real people.  I   personally think there is something there, but the topic is so   contaminated with misinformation that it is hard to know what is real and   what is not.
