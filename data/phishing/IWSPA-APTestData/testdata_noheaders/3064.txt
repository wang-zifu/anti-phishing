Hi Sara,

Thanks for helping set up my meeting with User two weeks ago.  I'll be  
in DC next week (Wed, Thurs, and Friday), and I was hoping you could  
see if User has any time to meet on any of those days so I could  
update him on my progress and get his counsel on my next steps.

Thanks so much,
Steve Phillips
