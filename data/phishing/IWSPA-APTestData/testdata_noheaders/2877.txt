Dear User,

A quick note to thank you and Mary for a most enjoyable dinner and conversation yesterday. 
Needless to say, both Ashok and I were delighted to be with you and Mary again  for such a special evening.
It was a pleasure to meet your brother user, ( I did not know earlier you had a brother) 
We had not met Neera's husband Ben before, and it was good to meet him, too.

Wishing you safe and successful journeys for your planned schedules ahead. 

Warmest regards, and big hugs to you and Mary,

Amrita
