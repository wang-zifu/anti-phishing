"Fwd: A MONSTER CALLS - official submission

Here is the submission info.   Hannah and I spoke this am and agreed that the question is is this a movie that organization should try to do, and then if so, whether Columbia or tristar or working together in some way would be best.

I'm actually encouraged by this initial info, as they didn't sell other territories as she intimated and I asked her please not to do.   28 gross should come down at least 5 with uk tax domain.com and uk special fx deal.   Maybe even uk-Spain co prod deal.  

I am running p and Ls.

Land in ny in 2 hours.
