"Other travel plans   Lisa - for the rest of our trip in June we want to travel to Yerevan in   Armenia, Baku in Azerbeijan, and Tbilisi in Georgia. Can you tell me what   airline partners (if any) fly to those cities and how often? Sometimes   there are only one or two flights a week from Istanbul to other places due   to frictions there. We'd be leaving from Istanbul so I need to lock in   this part of the trip as far as what's possible before I set up meetings   in each of these cities. We could stay in Istanbul for two days then fly   somewhere else and do the rest of the Turkey domain.com at the end since we'll   be leaving again from Istanbul. Pls quote me fares too - where it's   available business class or first class is what we'd want.       Thanks,   Meredith",
