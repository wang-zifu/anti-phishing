"Alex,in your last email you said that it was possible to do PGR and Puebla in the same week. Is there any change of which I am not aware?Further, fill in the activities but don’t fill in who’s gonna take care of them.People are notified of entries and updates in the calendar, changing them too often generates confusion.Thanks,Daniele--Daniele MilanOperations ManagerHackingTeamMilan Singapore WashingtonDCwww.hackingteam.comemail: user@domain.com: + 39 334 6221194phone:  +39 02 29060603Begin forwarded message:From: ""Alex Velasco (Confluence)"" <user@domain.com>Subject: [confluence] Alex Velasco created a new ""Travel"" event in the ""Tentative Activities"" calendarDate: 31 Jan 2015 16:44:00 GMT+1To: <user@domain.com>Alex Velasco created a new ""Travel"" event in the ""Tentative Activities"" calendarAlex Velasco created a new ""Travel"" event in the Tentative Activities cal"
