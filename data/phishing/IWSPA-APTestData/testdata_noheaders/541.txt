Attached are some draft TPs for BO and JRB for the opening of tomorrow's
economic advisers meeting. This is for the closed press portion of the
meeting. My guess is that BO won't stick to these but should have them
just in case he wants to use them. I don't know how JRB operates with
these sorts of things.

I'm planning to include the BO ones in his briefing for the meeting, let
me know if anyone has edits, or if folks want another process for these.
