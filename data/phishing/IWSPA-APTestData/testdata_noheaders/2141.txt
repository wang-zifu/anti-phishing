"SAG Q&A Tonight

Good evening - Tonight we screened American Hustle for SAG Nom Comm, Academy members and members of the press at the DGA Theatre. In addition we included SAG Foundation and there was not an empty seat in the 600 seat theatre. We had to turn away members of SAG Foundation. Many of which will return to see the film tomorrow afternoon.

David and the cast received a standing ovation -- Matthew Weiner was our wonderful moderator. He was energetic and engaging with David and the cast. He talked about the writing, creative choices, the ensemble collaboration, and the music choices.  The q&a lasted 45 min, upon exiting Matt Weiner said it was the best film he'd seen all year.

Because they are all creatives, this was less of a traditional q&a and more of a celebratory conversation about the film.  domain.com remarks were excellent."
