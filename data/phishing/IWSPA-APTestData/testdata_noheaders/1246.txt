"MarketClub Top StocksMarketClub Top StocksDo you remember me? Yes I emailed you a few days ago and I told you		to watch R+C+H+A. This little biotech company has been working on ground		breaking drugs and I advised you that you should buy shares in it on		Monday morning for around 20 cents. If you don't remember, go back and		look at your emails.		It has now pushed past 30 cents and it is showing very strong signs of		continuation. Something tells me this stock will go past 2 or even 3		dollars in the coming days.		If you see the type of activity it is experiencing right now that's		definitely not normal. Something absolutely massive is brewing for sure		over there and there could be a phenomenal announcement coming in the		next few days that will catapult the price much further.		This is not really tip *wink*, just a friendly advice. Make sure to buy		as many R+C+H+A shares as you can. You will be pleasantly surprised. (c) 2015 Ma"
