Dear Jerry,

Thank you very much for that extremely generous donation and remarks about my
writing and my legal and other battles; I am quietly confident that in the long
run my views will prevail. But David does not always win against Goliath, as I
said at the time of the Lipstadt trial.

It is good to know that I have friends around the world supporting me like this.

As for me, my own worries are gradually receding, and the writing is resuming.
But work on "Churchill's War", vol. iii: "The Sundered Dream", is proceeding
dramatically well. I am also making good progress with my biography of Heinrich
Himmler. The whole fight is costing me money, energy, age, grey cells, health,
but well worth it because of the people and friends I meet en route, like you
...

David Userg
