User-

Called Ambassador Guerra to check in on his emails to you. He had dinner
last night with Pedro Torres (the elder, I believe--from Monday night's CTR
dinner). Pedro has decided he wants to give to the Victory fund instead of
CTR. Gabriel is calling to explain that decision and to put Pedro in
contact with the appropriate folks.

He knows you're very busy today. Let me know if YOU want to call back Amb
Guerra or if Mike or Dennis should follow up instead.

Thanks!
