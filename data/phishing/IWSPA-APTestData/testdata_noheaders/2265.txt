My rough transcript of Weaver on NPR:

NPR:  If Sanders needs to win 68 percent of the delegates going forward and falls short, doesn't he owe it to be honest with his supporters?
WEAVER:  Those percentages are a "media narrative." If we can close the gap on pledged delegates and have momentum, we can go to the convention and flip superdelegates. Because superdelegates realize that Sanders is better than Clinton against Trump. If superdelegates simply rubberstamp the person with the most pledged delegates, then what are they for?

NPR: The Senator sounds as though he's talking like he's outside the Democratic Party. Is he for party unity?
WEAVER: Yes, he is. He is for expanding the party not tearing down the party. Lots of people he's talked to at the Organizationbelieve the same thing about expanding the party.
