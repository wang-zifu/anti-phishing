Capt French,

  Thanks for the good discussion today.  This is encouraging news that the combined embassy endorsement/CTA is to be briefed to the Ambassador tomorrow.

  I'd like to reiterate the urgency of the CENTCOM request for the updated 1203 proposal document itself, so that CENTCOM has something in place to brief leadership and endorse when the tasker comes down to staff this package through OSD.  Additionally, the draft CTA language and any slides you use to brief and/or support this proposal that you can share with CENTCOM will help.

  v/r,

  Thomas A. Niday, Lt Col, USAF
