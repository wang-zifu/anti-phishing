I wanted to touch base with you about march allocations.
We have not received a plan from CDA or an accounting of jan and feb expenses.

We have touched base with tom and susan and they have said documents are with the lawyers.

CDA it appears have received resources from other places as they are up on the air in ohio and have done a test in PA.

They are recieiving press on the ads and we are concerned with the way FFA is portrayed today in User marshalls blog ( see below) and yesterday in the hotline.

I will let you know once we have the plan in hand.
We have no plans to move money until we have the plan in hand.

Please let us know if you have questions.
Thank you,
Amy
