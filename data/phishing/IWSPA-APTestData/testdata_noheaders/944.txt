Hi User,

 I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know some good
news â€“ Pav and I got engaged! We are looking to get married in the Spring
or Summer of next year. I would love for you and Mary to attend! With that
in mind, could you send me your address for the invite?

Separately, if your schedule permits in the coming weeks, we would love to
invite you out to dinner. If not, I would love to get coffee and catch up
if you are free in the coming weeks.

Best,

Teresita
