HSBC Bank has been receiving complaints 
      from our customers for unauthorised use of the HSBC Online accounts.
      As a result we periodically review HSBC Online Accounts and temporarily restrict access of those accounts which we think are vunerable to the unauthorised use.

      This message has been sent to you from HSBC Bank because we have noticed invalid login attempts into your account, due to this we are temporarily limiting and restricting your account access until we confirm your identity.

            To confirm your identity and remove your account limitation please following the link below.
