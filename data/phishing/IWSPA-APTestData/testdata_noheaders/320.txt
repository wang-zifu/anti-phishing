I would imagine you’re already aware that you can no longer access the support portal, however, if you would like to renew your support on this card now we will be willing to waive the reinstatement fee. To renew support on this card, please contact me and I can generate a quote for you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Please confirm receipt of this email. Kind regards, Joshua Joshua Courage Sales Development RepresentativeDavidson House, Forbury SquareReading, Berkshire, RG1 3EU +44 118 900 1441 Office domain.com  This message contains Emulex confidential information intended only for specific recipients and"
