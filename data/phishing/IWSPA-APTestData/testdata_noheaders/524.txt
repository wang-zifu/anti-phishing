"Friend -- 

With Election Day right around the corner, I wanted to take a  moment to talk about the importance of casting your vote in the midterm  elections.

When you vote, you make your  voice heard on the issues that affect us all – the issues that I fight for day  in and day out in Congress.

Raising the minimum wage, taking action on comprehensive immigration reform,  creating jobs – all of that starts with a simple trip to the voting booth.

Unfortunately, many people choose  to sit out of midterm elections – including many women. In 2010, about 22  million fewer unmarried women and 10 million fewer married women voted than in  2008.

This has to change. We  have to make sure we reach out and energize women voters and make sure they  know why voting will make a difference for the issues we care about. Because when women turn  out to vote, women candidates win.

So, I encourage you – young or  old, male or female, to please get out there and vote on November 4th!  Click here for more informat"
