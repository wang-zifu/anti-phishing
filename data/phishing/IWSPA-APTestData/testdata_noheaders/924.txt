Hello User - I had a good meeting on Monday afternoon with Victoria and
Jennifer. They are sending you a hard copy of what we discussed and I have
a copy in my possession that I will show my father when we are together
next though will not give him to ensure we respect and protect the
privilege of the documents and the process.  We discussed a few points
which they will or already have followed up with you on, including helping
define and the run the search for a terrific COO/ President as well as on a
couple other points. I am off to Arkansas today and then from there to
London on Friday, back on Tuesday to New York. That said. I'll always be
reachable by email and would be happy to connect by phone at any time
convenient for your if helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
