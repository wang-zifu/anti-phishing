Valerie Jarrett and Adam Hitchcock would like to meet with you at 7:00
AM on Wednesday, Aug. 27th in Denver. You have an 8:00 AM development
meeting with Lou Susman at the Ritz, so I could have them meet you there
for an early breakfast. 

Adam was also wondering if you would like to meet with Penny Pritzker
while you are in Denver? It looks like she is available on Sunday, so I
could set something up then if you would like?
