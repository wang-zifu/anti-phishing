Hello Mr.Userg,
My User is Allen Rouse and my wife and I will be attending your talk this
Saturday in NYC. I am part of the media group at Stormfront, I do a weekly
program on Stormfront Radio called "The Staropramen Show", Staropramen is my
userUser there. I would like to know if it would be possible for me to videotape
the talk on Saturday for Stormfront. Don Black, SF's proprietor has informed us
that a major overhaul is being done to the site in the coming weeks which will
include our own video hosting capabilities and it would be nice to have this
talk for this new feature. I look forward to meeting you and enjoying your
always brilliant and informative talks.

Yours truly,

Allen Rouse/Staropramen
