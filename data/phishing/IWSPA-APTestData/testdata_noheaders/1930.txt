User--

I wanted to check first to see if this is a viable e-mail address for you, and then I know you're exceptionally busy with the campaign (which is why I'm contacting you via my personal e-mail address), but I was hopeful I might be able to engage with you on the matter of the Obama Administration's efforts to proclaim national monuments.  I can either lay it out in an e-mail, or if it works, just get on the phone for a 15-minute call to go over it--where we see things, what concerns we have, and to get your suggestions on how we can contribute and insert ourselves constructively, adding value.

I'm the guy who introduced you at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Wilderness Act that Tom Campion roped you into.  I work for The Pew Charitable Trusts, just for reference.

Thanks,

Mike Matz
