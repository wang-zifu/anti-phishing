And he said, I     will not destroy it for ten's sake. 18:33 And the LORD went his way, as     soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto     his place. 19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat     in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he     bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold     now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry     all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on     your ways.
