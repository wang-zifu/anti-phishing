"A Favor

Dear Sarah,

I know I've asked you in the past to do this and you have been very generous with your time.

May I ask one more time for you to meet with an extremely promising young man who wants to have a career in TV.

His User is David Weightman and he'll be in touch with your office.  I've also attached his CV for your review.

If you or someone in your office can spend 30 mins with him it would be greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,

Michael
