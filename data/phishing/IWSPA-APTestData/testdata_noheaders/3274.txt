Ah gotcha. What I can do is just send you the dial in for what's
appropriate 15 mins before hand.

Here's the calendar as I have it today:
1:44 pm Arrival at NYP
Taxi to 120 West 45th St (between 6th & 7th Aves) -- 19th Floor, HRC
Personal Office

2:30 - 4:30 pm Econ Meeting

5-5:45 pm: Earned Media Call
Dial-In Number: (712) 775-7031 // Passcode: 348-729-735

5:45-6:15 pm:
Call to Discuss Planning Committee Video
Dial-In: (202) 765-0457 // PIN: 94230

6:15 pm: Depart office for dinner
Esca, 402 West 43rd Street, New York, NY, United States

6:30 - 8:30 pm: Dinner

I'll watch to see if Amtrak opens up any earlier trains in the 9 pm hour.
Otherwise:
10:05 pm Amtrak from NYP to WAS
