Feinstein asked that you come over to her place (3300 Nebraska Ave NW) at
*11:30am* instead of 11:45am. That gives you less time on the call, but
should still be workable. She has to leave around 12:15pm to get downtown
to the State Department Xi lunch.

*For the Call: *Attached is a brief memo we sent to Albright, Panetta, and
Bayh.  Also attached the invite list. Laura Rosenberger will send us the
confirmed participant list later tonight.
