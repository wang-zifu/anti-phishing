Professor user,

The bookstore has not received a textbook order for Congressional Investigations Seminar.  Please contact the Bookstore Course Materials Manager, Paul Concannon, at 0877user@domain.com<mailto:0877user@domain.com> or at (202) 662-9628<tel:%28202%29%20662-9628> as soon as possible if you are ordering textbooks.  He will need to place a rush order to get the books in time for the start of school.

If you are not ordering a required or recommended textbook for the spring, would you please send a quick email confirming your decision to me and Paul so that we can cross your course off the ""missing adoptions"" list?

Thanks,

Dominique
