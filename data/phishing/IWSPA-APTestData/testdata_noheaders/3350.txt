Pharell did the song for despicable me this year and is in the academy race.  Jay organization didn't even LISTEN to Jamie's song.  If they said that they would do that song we would discuss it but they didn't.  That comes from when they were on the set with Jamie and Jamie sang some of it I think.  Did james say he would help?
