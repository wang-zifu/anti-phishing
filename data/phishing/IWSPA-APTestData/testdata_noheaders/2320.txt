User see below. Short fuse question regarding dinner tomorrow night. Did
you already make plans with Megan or can Michael go ahead and confirm this?
Could ask for it to end earlier if you want.

Hello - Quick update. Working with Priorities with regards to the 6pm-9pm
window this Friday in San Francisco. They're planning to schedule a small 8
or so person dinner at the Four Seasons (about 10-15 minutes away from the
briefing location).  Are we okay to confirm?

Thank you!
