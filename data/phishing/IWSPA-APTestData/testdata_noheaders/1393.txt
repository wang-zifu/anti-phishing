Dear Cagri

Let me worry this over.  It is a security issue for us.  I have no objection to
you covering my talk - it is near Patterson in northern NJ, and you would be
getting an exclusive, but I need assurances.

What do you suggest? I  can be reached by cell phone at 305 923 6779 in the
event of difficulties. But not before 10 pm tonight, I am speaking in
Philadelphia from 7 pm.
