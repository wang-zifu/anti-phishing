Hi Amy,

As part of our strategy to remind the public about George W. Bush's legacy
and keep him relevant to the discussion in 2015 Americans United is
organizing a Bush Legacy Project. One of the key ""framing moments"" will be
Bush's last State of the Union address on January 28th. Americans United has
prepared a framing TV ad targeted at opinion leaders and the media, combined
with a strong earned media push. I'm going to make a request for a specific
amount of money early this week. It could be as high as $150K but I suspect
it will be lower.

Thanks,

Tom
