"a vacation request   Hi Mike,   I'd like to request 3 vacation days in January if possible: Jan. 14, 15,   and 16. I know I need to bring you paperwork as well, but I thought I'd go   ahead and ask by email just to make sure I don't forget when I'm in the   office tomorrow.   Thanks,   Jeremy Edwards   Writer   Strategic Forecasting, Inc.   (512)744-4321"
