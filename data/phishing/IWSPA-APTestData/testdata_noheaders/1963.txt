Good call this am!

Two thoughts (which are mostly obvious, but wanted to flag to discuss):

1) We really need to have a broad convo about what else is coming, esp vis
a vis Benghazi.  I know the framework so far has been to let the State team
handle this stuff, but I think big opportunities were missed in the Times
piece to demonstrate authenticity and candor and I think this experience
has demonstrated why we need the political team engaged.

2) We need to figure out how we handle this stuff operationally moving
forward--who is involved in the discussion and who is leading the
discussion.  We have a broader consulting team, etc, and I need to be clear
on my end on process and input.  I have a frustrated and anxious team,
which is fine for now, but I need to provide clarity and I want to leverage
their input because I think it's helpful.  We don't need them triaging with
us, but if we know what's coming they can help us plan.
