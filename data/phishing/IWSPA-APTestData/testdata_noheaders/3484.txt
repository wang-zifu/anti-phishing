"Request from a GV customer   I don't know how simple this ""simple resquest"" is, but if it is not, let   me know and I will talk to him.   Thanks.

Can they turn on     the Larger Text button in the right margin on the Situation Reports.     <<link>>           The reports are in small type which makes it much harder to scan     quickly. When I hit the Larger Text + button, nothing happens. This just     started yesterday. Thanks, Walt"
