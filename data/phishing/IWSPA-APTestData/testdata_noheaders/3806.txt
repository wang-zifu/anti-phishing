As a feature of our new site, domain.com, we¹ll be doing a
short round up of the morning news related to McCain, lobbyists, and
campaign donors (and sometimes Obama).

Dave Miller will be compiling it and posting every morning by 8:30 or so,
and sending it out to anyone who wants it. If you¹d like to be on that
distribution list, let Dave know at user@domain.com

From time to time, I¹ll also send it out here where there¹s lots to report.

For a sample, here¹s today¹s inaugural:
