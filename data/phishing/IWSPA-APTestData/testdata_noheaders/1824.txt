All,

Our next dinner will be Thursday, January 14 at 7:30pm.  The focus of our discussion will be the State of the Union Address, to have taken place two evening prior, on January 12.  Guest speaker TBD.   Please let us know if you can join.

Also, following up on last month's dinner re: trade - if any of you would like to be receiving updates (and aren't already) on the topic/issues from the White House, please let us know.

Have a happy and healthy holiday season.

Thank you,
Fariba
