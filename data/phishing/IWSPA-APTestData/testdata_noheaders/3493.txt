I'm writing a piece about Bernie's predicament in terms of how hard he
wants to attack HRC/Organizationand at what cost. Basically curious from your end
where his leverage points are to amend the platform (as we were discussing
at the debate) and what he needs to avoid doing to not overplay his hand.

Background is cool from a Organizationofficial.

What's a good time/number to call?

Thanks in advance.
