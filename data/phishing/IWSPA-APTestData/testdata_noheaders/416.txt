Hi guys
I've connected with SEIU Intl today and they have indicated that they are
no longer on a September endorsement path.  While September was never
confirmed, it is a departure from previous conversations.

Two things that I think would be helpful:

1.  JP reaching out to Mary Kay soon, get her thoughts, next steps needed,
etc.

2.  I think we need to lock in 1199SEIU.  As we've previously discussed,
we've worked out a compromise with them where 1199SEIU board will stop in
for a campaign briefing at Brooklyn HQ.  We would do this on a day that HRC
is in the office and she would be able to stop in and say hello.  I think
now, this could be helpful for us in their process.
