User--didn't want to tell you while you were cooking up a storm, but I hope you got the white binder I left on the bed. Quite a bit came in Friday night / Saturday morning, so I just threw it together and got you an updated schedule:
-Silicon Valley meetings really changed--Marissa Mayer is off, Tim Cook is on.
-On Ann O'Leary's draft briefing, definitely throw that out--one of the bios is the wrong Tim Wu. The one Ann sent you directly has the right one.
-NEA/AFT Prep, but a much better / longer / more compete one than I found in your gmail. Milia got it from Jake's team. 

CH's asst emailed to ask if pushing back to 9:30 pm tonight is ok, and I said yes. 

Happy Father's Day and safe travels this week!
