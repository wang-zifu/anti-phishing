All,

  First of all, a big thank you to LTC Roberts and LtCol Webb who made this Ordered Departure to Tampa happen.  Without them you would be at CFH Qatar rather than beautiful Tampa!

  To ensure that OMC operations run smoothly in Sana’a as well as in Tampa I am sending you the below guidance.  Please adhere to it, and treat it as your marching orders.  MSgt Puckett, MAJ Sparkman, please pass the below to your replacements.

  1. Chain of Command and Reporting:

  a. Your Chain of Command has not changed = Myself then COL Mack

  b.While in Tampa, if you cannot get in touch with COL Mack or with me, then ask for guidance from LtCol Webb or LTC Roberts.

  c. MAJ Medina:  In your absence from OMC Sana’a Capt . McVann is supporting your office and supervising your LESs.  As such, she is involved in the daily operations of your training office and will support the LES where a US presence is required.  Please add her to the cc line of all your com
