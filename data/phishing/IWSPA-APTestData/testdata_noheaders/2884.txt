Team -
Just reporting in.  I spoke with Kay and we had a very good talk.

She has been having a good day in that the "Bernie insurgency" has not been=
 showing out.

She believes it will be okay and folks will be respectful of the Chair.

She has requested extra security for the event which I emphasized was a goo=
d idea and recommended maybe a couple of more to be safe.

I think she is ready.

Scott
