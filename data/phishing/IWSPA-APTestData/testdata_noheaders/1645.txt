Hi guys

So I wanted to ask you something I was told: that the Sanders campaign sent=
 the Organizationrules and bylaws committee some kind of email or complaint about t=
he Nevada Democratic Party ahead of the primary charging that the party was=
n't following the state rules for the convention. This happened before the =
convention, I'm told, and didn't really domain.com any action since the conventi=
on hadn't happened yet. You guys know anything about that?
