"[livelines] How to choose a dog       Alright, I will have to chime in -- having traveled around the world with   3 standard dachshunds for 30 years -- but no more than 2 at a time.  We   found these dogs to be very good dogs with families, large enough to   withstand small children's but small enough not to hurt the children and   not to cost an arm and a leg to ship.  They all had distinct personalities   and survived travel well though some had the back problems and diabetes   characteristic of the breed.  We were able to buy them at our posts and   one even paid for her trip home by having puppies. Before the dachies we   adopted a street dog from Jakarta who developed canine epilepsy, began to   bite and had to be put down.  We now have a small (20 pounds) terrier mix   from the DC pound who is a real sweetie and adores the grandchildren.  She   even likes to cuddle with the cat.
