I read today's WaPo story about Biden's push for prominent Obama supporters and anticipate a number of follow-on stories from other reporters. If it helps, I am happy to go on-the-record with any reporters asking about Obama bundlers breaking ranks from the Clinton campaign to join Biden. As very early and prominent Obama bundlers, Sylvia and I are firmly in Hillary's corner and are happy to help communicate how passionate Obama bundlers like us are about making sure Hillary is President in 2015 <br><br><br>Frank<br><br><br>Sent from XFINITY Connect Mobile App
