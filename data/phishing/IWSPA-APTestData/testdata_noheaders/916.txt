Georgetown organization Law Center, the American Constitution Society and the Campaign Legal Center have joined together to establish a Voting Rights Institute at Georgetown Law.  The Institute will be formally announced at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on Friday, October 2.

“There has never been a Voting Rights Institute like the one we’re creating at Georgetown Law,” said Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor. “In a time of intense concern for and scrutiny of voting rights, the Institute will develop innovative legal and policy solutions that protect the right to vote, while training the next generation of lawyers and leaders. Our goal is to make the Voting Rights Institute at Georgetown Law a hub of thoughtful engagement on all voting rights issues in the U.S.”
