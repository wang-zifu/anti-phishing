Jake,

Hillary needs to be more personal and force on Sander's Single Payer Plan,
and tie it to the President. She is making it too academic. Why not
something like this:

""Bernie, you should know how incredibly difficult it was for President Obama
to pass the Affordable Health Care Act. There wasn't one Republican vote for
it in the Senate or House. If you rip this up and start over again, the
Republicans in Congress will use it as the opportunity to kill the
President's most important accomplishment, not to make it a totally
government run program. This is another example of your pie-in-the-sky
ideas.""
