Hey everyone!

If you didn't already know, Tom is celebrating a birthday this weekend! Since he's out today, we're going to celebrate when he returns on Monday. As usual, please contribute $5 in cash, paypal (user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>) or venmo (@Jenna-Price-2) so Rachel and I can coordinate the celebration.

Thanks!
