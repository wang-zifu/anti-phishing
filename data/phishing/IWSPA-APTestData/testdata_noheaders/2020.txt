Per the conversation we just had, attached is the ""in progress"" memo
that just went in to BO. Laura Tyson took the lead on this and other
outside advisers are working on it as well. I don't expect that we will
announce any of this pre-11/4 but BO wanted to know what we were
thinking about in case it informs the way he talks about his current
policies in media interviews and other settings.
