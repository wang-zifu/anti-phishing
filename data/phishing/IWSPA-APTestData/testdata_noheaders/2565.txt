I ended up asking for 17.5 and they gave me 14k options which is pretty good and apparently the most anyone has except vps. And they agreed to the 20% bonus (which is standard for vps only). I should have asked for the bigger signing too - I think they might have moved there.

Oh well - good lessons learned!
