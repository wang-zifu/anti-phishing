"our talk yesterday/a candidate

 Jody: Nice seeing you yesterday.  Attached is the resume of Jonathan Schwartz. He is an attorney by training (probably around 30 years old), spent some time at Strook and Strook in Century City (so he has some big law firm experience), and also spent some time here as a legal intern. He is extremely personable, uber hard-working, and loves loves the entertainment space. I know him personally and vouch for him completely. I think you would enjoy speaking with him, and he has expressed a lot of interest in this possible opportunity.

Do you want me to have him contact you?

Thanks

ag
