Hello,
How are you this weekend ? I'm pleased to write to you today as I was

directed to you from the earth science department in your school .. I

have a 20 years old boy who is about to resume for his 2nd year in

Durham organization here in England but he will be coming over for the

Christmas and new year break any time soon .... I'd like a professor ,

lecturer or a teaching assistant who will tutor him the basics of the

following earth science subjects, Structural Geology and Tectonics,

Sedimentary Environments, Igneous and Metamorphic Geochemistry ... I

hope to get a positive response as soon as possible so we can conclude

this arrangement ... Thanks and God bless. Regards!
Jerry Lad
