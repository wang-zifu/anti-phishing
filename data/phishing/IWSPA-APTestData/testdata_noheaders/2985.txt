Hi User-

Anne Gearan just told me and Brian that her deadline for the HRC policy
team story is tonight at 6:00 pm. She said she's available to talk later
this evening and can add your comments (on the record or on background) in
to her working draft.

No worries either way- just wanted to make sure you knew her deadline.

Her numbers, just in case: office  <202-334-9598>202-334-9598
<<<link>>>. mobile  <202-615-9036>
202-615-9036 <<<link>>>.

Thanks!
Milia
