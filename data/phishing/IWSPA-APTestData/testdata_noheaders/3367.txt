"FW: A thought...

Hi Nigel-

I hope you had a great weekend.

I wanted to loop you in to something we’re going to do domestically that we’d like to replicate for your key markets.

I’ve cc’d Mike Pavlic on it. 

Please read through and let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you very much.

Hi Mike-

Our side likes this idea.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.

I think we should consider when we get Franco clean shaven and he does more Skylark stuff, to do countdown tags that could ostensibly be used for TV spots as well as domain.com.

It would be along the lines of “This Friday, check out my exclusive interview with Kim Jong Un,” “4 days away,” “tomorrow,” and a generic.  This could also be used internationally and even for DVD.

What are your thoughts?
