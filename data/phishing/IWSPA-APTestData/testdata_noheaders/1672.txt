Sir,

  Maj Christine Anouchian, inbound, e-mailed me last week, so I replied to her today and provided her the OMC reporting instructions as well as the TDY FAQs I was sent.  I’ve encouraged her to bring any questions she has to me and hopefully get on the phone with me sometime soon.  I don’t know yet when she’s supposed to arrive, but I asked her to tell me what’s on her RIP.  I assume you’ll want to get in contact with her as well, though I took the liberty of forwarding her the welcome letter I received from Lt Col Roberts just so she could have as much information as possible without delay to get working on the things she needs to get done.  I do not know if she’s tracking the requirements for FACT or SCM-O, but I did bring those to her attention and will try to help her with questions about registering for those as well.

  The e-mail I have for her is user@domain.com  I do not have a .mil address or phone number for her at this time.

  V/r,

  Maj Matt
