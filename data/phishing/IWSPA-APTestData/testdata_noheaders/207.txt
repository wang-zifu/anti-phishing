Advisory Group Members,

Thank you for agreeing to serve on our newly-expanded group to provide strategic direction to CGI.

Next Wednesday's session will be divided into two parts.  The first meeting, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, is designed to serve as an orientation for those joining us for the first time and will provide background on the evolution of CGI over the past eight years.  The second meeting will be from 11:00 AM until 1:00 PM, and President Clinton will join us during that time period.  That meeting will include updates on our various activities and will seek guidance from you on a number of matters we need to address.

Attached are materials for both meetings.  I look forward to seeing you on March 13th in our new offices, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, 42nd floor, New York City.  Lunch will be served.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Ed Hughes, Scarlet Cronin (my assistant), or me.

Best,

Bob
