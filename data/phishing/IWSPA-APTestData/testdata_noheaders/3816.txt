          Have Cancer: a Medical Marijuana Story”, and we are

        seeking to collaborate

        with other Production Companies and Financiers for this project.

This is the

        first ‘Serious

        Themed’ Medical Marijuana movie and it’s about a lady who gets

        Breast Cancer

        and her best friend convinces her to try marijuana to help

        combat her pain and

        illness. 

The story is

        very positive

        for Breast Cancer Awareness and the Medical Marijuana movement.  Some cool celebrities are
