Friend,

We're three hours from our midnight fundraising deadline and
just $6,542 from hitting our goal.

Your donation could be the one that puts us over the top.
Will you give $5 right now?

I'm so humbled by the outpouring of support we've seen this
week.

I know losing this election is a pretty scary prospect for
lots of folks -- but if we all put some skin in the game, we
won't let that happen.

Thanks again,

Terry
