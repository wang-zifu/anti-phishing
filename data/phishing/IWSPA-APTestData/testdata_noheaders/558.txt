TIME Exclusive: Donald Trump Shifts Immigration Tone in Meeting with Hispanic Evangelical Leader<<>>

OrganizationSpokesperson ________ issued the following statement in response to a report<<>> that Donald Trump shifted his tone on Latinos in a private meeting:

"There's no other way to put it: Donald Trump has disrespected Latinos time and time again. He has called Mexicans 'rapists' and 'drug-dealers'; he has called for deporting all undocumented immigrants; and he has called for ending President Obama's executive actions on immigration, DAPA and DACA. Latinos will not forget this when they go out to vote in November regardless of how much Trump tries to change his tone."
