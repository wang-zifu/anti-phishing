I received my third call today from donors who have been approached by R4H/Adam P. to give them $ in the past week.  The pitch they are giving is that they thought HRC was going to announce in January, but now itâ€™s looking more than April 1. In order to keep R4H operating until then (pay their staff, continue building the list, etc.), they need to raise $900,000 between now and then.

This is obvious not helpful and causing a lot of donor confusion.

Not sure if anything can be done about it, but wanted to share this.
