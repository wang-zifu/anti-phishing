User,

An additional thought on the announcements you are planning today or tomorrow to make the list even more robust.  You could announce that the PE has asked Donley to remain as Secretary of the Air Force, Clapper as USD(Intelligence) and Vickers as Asst Secretary for SOLIC, all for at least a year.
