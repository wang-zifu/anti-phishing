I suppose I should probably provide a little more context for you all.  My
vision is 20/20 in my right eye, 20/25 in my left.  The Doc said that my
vision is great and that I don't need glasses.  But since glasses are free
in the military, he decided to order me a pair nonetheless--military
medicine at its finest!

Despite the fact that I don't need them, I've actually been wearing them
quite a bit. It feels like going from TV to HDTV.
