Hey, the Wall Street Journal is asking if the Rules committee has any jurisdiction over the items Bernie wants, like changing rules to encourage open primaries, recommend bonus delegates for states that do that - for example --

Is it accurate to say that the Convention Rules Committee only deals with rules specific to the functioning of the 2015 convention? What should we say?

Similarly, if they did want to make such changes, there would have to be some kind of commission like the one that took Supers from 20% to 15%, right?
