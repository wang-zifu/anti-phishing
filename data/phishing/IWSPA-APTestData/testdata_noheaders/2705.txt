Hello, friends.  What would you think about her doing interviews
around corporate purpose?  Like maybe with Joe Klein, Jonathan Alter
and or EJ?   Last week we thought maybe we should give her some time
post-overall speech before putting her in an on the record setting.
What do you think now?  Thanks, all
