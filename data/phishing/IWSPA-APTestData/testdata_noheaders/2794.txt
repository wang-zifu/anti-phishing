Dear Professor user, 

I am one of the students who attended your class Monday evening. Unfortunately, I am on the waitlist. I thoroughly enjoyed your class and hope that I will be able to learn from you and Judge Leon; it would be a great privilege. I am wondering whether you might be able to allow me to take the course despite my position on the waitlist. I understand you are extremely busy and will patiently domain.com for your reply. Thank you for taking my request to consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Russell Martinez
