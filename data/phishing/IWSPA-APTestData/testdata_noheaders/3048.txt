Yesterday wasn't a good one for women's health, User.
First: the GOP launched their first hearing on Planned Parenthood.
Then: Instead of listening to the issues, the GOP just shouted partisan attacks against the President of Planned Parenthood.
And worst of all: Radical Republicans forced a bill through Congress that gave radical Republican-controlled states the ability to GUT funding for Planned Parenthood.

User, if we're able to count on your support, we're going to be able to go on the offensive and hold accountable each Republican who has attacked Planned Parenthood.

But we can't do it alone. Please click here and rush an emergency contribution to our Rapid Response fund before it's too late. (<<link>>)
