Dear Colleagues,

Iâ€™m sad to report the death of Mildred H. Bristol mother of Scott Bristol during this holiday break. A funeral service is being held for Mildred H. Bristol at The United House Of Prayer For All People located at 17217 Street, NW, Washington, DC from 10:00AM to 1:00PM on Monday, January 4th, 2016.

Our prayers and thoughts are with Scott and his family.

Sadly,

Peter
