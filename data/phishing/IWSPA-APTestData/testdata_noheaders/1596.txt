"A little help.....

Hey Steve-

We're hitting a speed bump on District 9.  As discussed, Playstation and Andy House are really excited at the possibility of having SPT produce District 9 as a premium series as their first signature show.  They would want 10 episodes a year, commencing sometime next fall.  Amy wrote Neil an e-mail and he seemed enthusiastic.  Now that this is becoming real, and everyone wants to push this forward, Amy feels she can't press Neil and Peter Jackson this quickly and believes the process needs to evolve more slowly.

Any chance Peter Schlessel could offer any help or insight or guidance.  We've wanted to make this a hit series since the movie came out....

Thanks Steve."
