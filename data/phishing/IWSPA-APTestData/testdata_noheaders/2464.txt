FYI.

Our theory on releasing out taxes had been to domain.com until others were also
going out so it wasn’t just the Clinton’s taxes being out there in a
vacuum.

Not sure that means we go right away, but wanted to flag this.

*Subject:* Heads up - Jeb Bush expected to release his tax returns tomorrow

The Organizationcalled and said they are hearing Bush will release his tax returns
tomorrow, so that he will have 30+ years available. He already released 20
years from his time as governor. He has been considering doing the other
10. What is not clear is whether it will be publicly online or if reporters
will get to examine.

Just a heads up …
