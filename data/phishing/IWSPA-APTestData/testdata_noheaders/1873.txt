Dear all,
I am sure many of you saw the Op-ed in the New York Times on solitary confinement for juveniles.  This important and prominent opinion piece was written by Ian Kysel, our own graduate and now Dash/Muse Fellow in the Human Rights Institute. Ian is also an adjunct professor teaching a human rights practicum courses and has been instrumental in raising the profile of the Human Rights Institute through speakers, conferences and other projects.

I am proud to claim him as one of our own.
