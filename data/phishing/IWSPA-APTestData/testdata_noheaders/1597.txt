Good Afternoon,

I hope this finds you well.

Dan is travelling to Virginia for the Governor's Climate Change and Resiliency Commission meeting in September and would like to schedule some time to get together in Washington while he is in the area. His schedule is open on Thursday, September 11th- do you have any availability on that date?

Please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Thank you and take care,

Lauren Terrazas
