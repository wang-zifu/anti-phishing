I think we can handle not with a staffer but with an identifiable lead.

User,
We are starting to flush out our political engagement plan, which I would love to walk through with you and obtain your feedback in the next couple of weeks. 
One timely question for you is your opinion on whether we need a full time staff person for the campaign in Arkansas. The plan is to have a political staffer in NY and in DC as we move forward. Robby and I discussed whether there is a need for one in Arkansas and wanted your advice. This person would be responsible for proactive engagement, continually updating our key people and constiuencies on the different phases of the campaign. 
Happy to talk through further or answer any questions. Wanted to get a gut check on if you thought this was a necessity. Robby, anything to add?
Thank you!
Marlon
