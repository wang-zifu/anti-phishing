"Next week's travel   On Tuesday when we fly to Dallas on Fl 1827 we would like a car to meet us   at the airport and take us to the Ritz Carlton hotel where we're staying.   Would you please book that for us? Also we would like to have the car domain.com   for us and then take us to an address in Dallas where we're going for   dinner - I need to get the address but can forward it to you when I get   it. We'd just check in and probably change and need to be at the dinner by   6p.m.       Then on Thursday Dec 9 we would like to get an earlier flight from Kansas   City to Las Vegas. Is there an earlier AA flight still availabe? I know   the earlier southwest are fully booked. We could leave as early as 3p.m.   for Las Vegas.       Thanks Lisa.
