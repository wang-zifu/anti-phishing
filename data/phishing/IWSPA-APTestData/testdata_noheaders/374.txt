Team,

Attached are infrastructure-focused remarks for tomorrowâ€™s organizing event
in Florida. These are based on the meat of the Boston remarks, with Florida
input from Lorella, Jesse, and Schmidt, and comments from Dan. Research, I
have included links to the new facts that did not appear in the Boston
remarks.

*Please send edits by 5pm today*.

Thanks,

Kristina
