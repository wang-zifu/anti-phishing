Gentlemen,

  Good afternoon, hope this email finds you well.

  I met with reps from Textron Aviation (Beechcraft/Cessna/Hawker) this morning, Mr. David Wildes and Mr. Steve Otto. They expressed interest in reaching out to POCs on the ground in company to determine whether there may be interest in future systems/DCS from YAF.

  I've cc'd them in the subject line so they can engage as needed.

  Have a great weekend!
