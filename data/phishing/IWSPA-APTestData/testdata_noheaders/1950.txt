"Question on luggage restrictions   Lisa - I need to know on suitcase limitations for the airlines we're   traveling on - I bought two new suitcases (with Platinum points) that are   lightweight but I got larger ones since we'll be traveling for almost 3   weeks and need a lot of different types of clothing. I got 29"" suitcases.   I'm not worried about the weight issue but can you tell me if we're fine   with the size on these cases? Thanks very much.       Thanks much.       Meredith",
