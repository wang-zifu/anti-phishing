=E2=80=9CHillary Clinton is grateful to the thousands of Nevadans who came =
out to
participate in the caucuses and convention process. She believes every
voice should be heard and no one should be intimidated, harassed or
threatened in this process.  When the primary process is complete, our
party must come together and ensure a Democrat is elected to serve as our
next president.

Democrats should be proud that nearly 23 million people have participated
in our primary and that both campaigns have worked so hard to advance ideas
that will improve the lives of Americans.   That is a stark contrast with
the divisive policies that have come from the Republicans. Supporters of
both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the work they have put into
their campaigns.

Ultimately, we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary
will be united in a common purpose=E2=80=94to move forward the ideals of ou=
