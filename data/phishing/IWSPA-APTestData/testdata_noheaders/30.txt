Dear Mr user,
I first apologize for my bad english, but I am not an american citizen. 
I am a big supporter of Mrs Clinton and I fully support her 2015 US Presidential Candidacy. For that reason I wanted to contribute as far as I could to her Presidential Campaign.
I signed up on her domain.com site and tried do make a little donation, but sadly this option is available only to those who live in the United States, and so is for Items Shop. 
I wanted to ask you if there is an alternative way for foreign countries citizens to contribute to the campaign. 
As her Chair, I thought I could have got an answer to this issue.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon,
               Yours Sincerely, From Italy, Pavel Belli
