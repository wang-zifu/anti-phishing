Shoot just saw this sorry.  Mel had asked me for tickets months ago and I got them up for her but then she said she wanted ones more towards the end of the show, the finals.  Kim Rozenfeld was helping me and we got her on a domain.com list but the other day he said he was unable to get the tickets.  I told her next season I could get them for her but still can’t guarantee the finals.
