Did you know you can generate a donation to the Los Angeles Mission at absolutely no cost to you when you shop online at stores like Amazon, Nordstrom, Walmart and more than 4,000 other online retailers? 

All you have to do is make one click through Ziggedy before you shop, and an average of 3% (up to 30% depending on retailer) will be donated directly to the Los Angeles Mission. 

We need your help to provide meals and care for hungry, homeless people. Please follow these quick steps to get started: 

1) Click here to create your Ziggedy account now

2) Shop through Ziggedy to your favorite stores!

Thank you for your support and participation!
