Dear User - 

See below. Lest we forget.

She did great last night. Whoever came up with like of ""May the force be with you"" deserves a reward. But I know who came up with the line, ""Sorry!""

Carolyn and I send our best wishes to you and Mary and the entire user family for a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year. 

And may the force be with you personally too!

Lanny
