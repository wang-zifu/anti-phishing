User/Eric,

I have to run to another meeting. Can one of you get back to David Goldstein (info below) at McClatchy in the next 30 min/hour? He is Lightman's boss.

David is hoping to chat with the Chair today about party fundraising and also the money to fund the convention. How the public funds/subsidies for the convention were cut by Congress and that since then the amounts individuals can give to the convention, and the parties more generally, have gone up. Does this help the party in the age of SuperPACs?

Thanks,
Mark
