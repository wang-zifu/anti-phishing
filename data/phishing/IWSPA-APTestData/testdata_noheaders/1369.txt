At noon today (Tuesday), Ruthanne Deutsch will talk to us about her paper entitled ""Federalizing Retroactivity Rules:  The Unrealized Promise of Danforth v. Minnesota and the Unmet Obligation of State Courts to Vindicate Federal Constitutional Rights.  The paper was attached to an earlier email and is available at Faculty Support and here Ruthanne Deutsch- Federalizing Retroactivity Rules - The Unrealized Promise of Danforth v. Minnesota and the Unmet Obligation of State Courts to Vindicate Federal Constitutional Rights<<<link>>>.

We meet in McDonough 492.  Cookies and drinks will be served.

I am also taking shameless advantage of the fact that I control these emails to attach a new, revised, completed, but still preliminary draft of my paper, which I will discuss on Thursday.
