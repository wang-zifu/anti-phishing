Dear valued PayPal member: 

PayPal 
is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of 

buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs 

some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud 

teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your 

account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your 

account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your 

account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This 

is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not 

compromised. 

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may 

require some specific information from you for the following reason: 

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an 

unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account 

is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account 

features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 

understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 

Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 

Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 

time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.                                     
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July
27, 2005. 

Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be 
interrupted and will continue as normal.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 
Please understand that 

this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. We 

apologize for any inconvenience. 

Sincerely,
