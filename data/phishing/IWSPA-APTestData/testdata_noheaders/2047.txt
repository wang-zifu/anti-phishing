User,

Today's the day. This is your last chance to RSVP for our exclusive Environmental Majority Council conference call with LCV pollster Joel Benenson.

He will share insights from two recent polls on climate change, including one focusing on how climate change stands to become a defining issue for young voters nationwide.  We'll also discuss what this shifting landscape means for the President's climate plan and the future of environmental politics.

The call is being held today, Wednesday, September 4th from 3pm - 4pm ET.

To RSVP and receive the call-in number for today's call, please contact Josh Hicks at (202) 454-4565 or user@domain.com

Hope to talk to you soon,

Stacey
