Mr. Scholte,

  Sir, as you are probably aware, Maj Vincent is eligible for the FY15 Officer RIF Board (Board L0414A).  In preparation for the board, please prepare his RRF and supporting documentation to include:

  1.  SURF

  2.  Draft RRF (AF Form 3538) - blank attached; Blocks I - V

  3.  Proof Sheet - template attached; see notes at bottom of template

  4.  All OPRs and Decs - highlighted corresponding to the Proof Sheet inputs (you can send hardcopies vs. scanning)

  5.  AF Physical Fitness Assessment Printout

  I've also attached the PSDM and Senior Rater Notification for your reference.

  Suspense to the A4/7 Workflow is COB 2 Jul 14.  Feel free to send any supporting documentation earlier so we can start building up the PRF 6-part folders.

  V/R,

  JOO
