User -

I need to talk to you about SEIU today.  As you know, they are having their
exec meeting on Wednesday.  I've been doing policy conversations on child
care and health care, and talked a bit to HRC about it this weekend.

Really want to be sure to run my answer by you before getting back to them.

Is there a good time I could give you a buzz?  Or call me at your
convenience: 510-717-5518

Thanks,
Ann
