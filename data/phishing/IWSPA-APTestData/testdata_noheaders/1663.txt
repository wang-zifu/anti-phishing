"Washington DC next week   Hello Lisa -       We need a hotel in DC next week for August 10 and 11 (and maybe Aug 9   depending on air ticket availability) and noticed the Park Hyatt on 24th   and M streets which would be very convenient to where we have to be. We   need to be in DC by mid to late afternoon on the 10th and will return to   Austin on the 12th. Can you check on AA and Continental for us and see   what's available and what the fares are please? Departure should be   morning of Aug 10 or late afternoon of Aug 9. Thanks very much.       If this works we'll use this hotel again for Aug 23-26 (3 nights) as well.   Thanks very much.       Meredith Friedman   cell - 512 426 5107",
