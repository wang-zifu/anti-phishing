Two quick points:
1)Might be good to slam Rand Paul's comment that ""if you work all day long,
you don't have time to do heroin"" as contrast/out of touch with the woman
who says we are sick people trying to do well
2) agree with Huma and would add that it would be good to do more to
highlight great plans MA has put in place to address problem and any
measures of success they have had (from Sara's background memo)

Team,

Attaching two pages of TPs for HRC's substance abuse event Thursday in
Boston. She will not have a podium for this event, so keeping these short.
They are based off the Laconia town hall TPs with some Boston-area flavor.

Please send edits/comments/approvals by *10am Wednesday*, as I will be
offline for most of Wednesday afternoon and want to make sure we get this
buttoned up in time for the book.

Thanks all!

Kristina
