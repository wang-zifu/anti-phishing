User,

You.

Quite simply, you're the reason for this victory. I've asked so much of you in the past few weeks, and you've never once let me down.

Seeing your commitment to fighting for what matters - access to jobs and education - has only inspired me to fight harder.

I'm headed to Congress fired up and ready to help make this country a place where the words ""equality"" and ""opportunity"" carry serious weight.

I truly couldn't have done this without you
