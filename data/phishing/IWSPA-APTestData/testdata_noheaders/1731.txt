Mike,

  Can you confirm if the Presidential Guard will use national funds (their

  own money) to pay for this request? The Procurement Department has not

  brought up this endeavor to the OMC. I’m not sure why they haven’t  but

  I appreciate you discussing with me.  If you see requests like this in

  the future from other units within the MoI and MoD, let Capt French and

  Major Vincent know.  They are OMC’s EEUM monitors and should be able to

  assists as needed.

  COL Rosin,

  Sir, do we need to discuss with the Procurement Department?
