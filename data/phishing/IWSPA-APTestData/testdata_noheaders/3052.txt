Steve,

Sorry for the delay, here is the ad sales model for Mind of a Man, the barter domain.com is 4.5L/2.5N, for both the M-F and the Weekend runs.  Again, we are just starting to open and pitch major groups and markets.  Attached is the financial model….if you have any other questions, please let me know…thanks.  GSN will match our barter with their runs, which helps cume the national number.
