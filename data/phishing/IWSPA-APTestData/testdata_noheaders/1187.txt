Hey User -

Should have reached out earlier, but why not use the craziest news cycle to=
 do it! I just wanted to check in on this insanity from the Sanders camp. I=
 haven't heard anything about it (I'm assuming because the world is Trump'd=
) but I don't have a handle on how to respond when people turn attention to=
 Dems.

Are you fielding a lot of heat on this - or do you think it's too wonky for=
 anyone to dig in on?
