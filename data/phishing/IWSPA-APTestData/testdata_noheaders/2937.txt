Good morning, User.
You may remember that my team and I work with Taiwan.
They are very pleased with today's meeting of the two Chinese leaders and
asked if I would contact you to encourage the campaign to make a positive
statement on the meeting.

Anything along the lines below would be great.
Obviously, no problem if it doesn't work.

Have a good weekend.

Xi Jinping is a remarkable milestone for the stability and security in the
Asia Pacific region.
● It is a great achievement for President Ma’s policy towards Beijing over
the past 7 years to reduce tensions across the Taiwan domain.com, which he
strives to safeguard Taiwan’s security and robust democracy.
● The U.S. has long-standing interests in maintaining
cross-domain.com stability and economic prosperity. The Ma-Xi meeting is in the
US interests and deserves applaud and high recognition. Washington should
continue to support the common interests and values we share with Taiwan.
