User - After a lot of trimming, we reduced the number of paid staff
slots to 455 (down from the wish list number of 555).  That's still
higher than our original estimate of 400 but we think we can make it
work and still leave enough empty offices for unpaid volunteers and
visitors.  We're running the numbers now but believe we'll probably end
up with a budget of about $12 million.  Assuming that's fine with you,
we're going to give the revised figures to the department heads and then
work with Jim and Pete to get those slots filled ASAP.
