User-I am coming to the Finance Committee meeting in Brooklyn on Thursday.
I assume that you will around that day.

Is there any chance that we could meet briefly-15 minutes-to discuss
processes to incorporate consideration of white ethnic voters in the
polling, messaging, policymaking and field operations of the campaign?  This
could be before or after the finance meeting.

Please let me know.  Thanks.-Bruce
