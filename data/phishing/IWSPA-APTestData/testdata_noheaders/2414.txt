Great to see you even for a little bit here in Aspen.  The challenges
are so daunting that sometimes I wonder if all this talk  really helps,
and then I see that connections are being made and work being organized
that will actually make progress.  In any event, we are definitely going
up to Truckee weekend of 8/7-9.  WE will be staying at Guy Saperstein's
guesthouse, but I hope we can get together Sat in the afternoon or for
dinner, let us know.  My cell is 5103875680.  Best, Maria  best to Mary
