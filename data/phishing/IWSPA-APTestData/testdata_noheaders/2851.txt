Mr. user,
I emailed you a few weeks ago reintroducing myself to you via Alice Germond.

I am certain that you have been inundated with resumes and requests for
interviews and positions on the Transition Team - and I want to add my User
to that list.

I have moved back to DC from Western PA and am anxious to get working again
- and nothing would thrill me more than getting to continue my work for
President-Elect Obama.

Attached you will find my resume.  Please do consider me for openings on the
team.  I have ample experience in both campaigns and in working for
electeds. I know that my skill sets, attitude and work ethic will make me a
valuable member to the team. And, of course, please contact me at any time
if you need more information.

I hope all is well,
Matthew McClellan
