Zahi,

  The PMR for the AT-802 manned ISR program is planned for 16 & 17 Dec (see the rough agenda below).  I had no notion of trying to attend from company, but since I'm in the States for the time being, I think it would be a value-added opportunity for me to engage many of my CONUS counterparts face to face, with the obvious caveat that I could be directed to return to company prior to the meeting and have to cancel.  Travel dates would be the 15th and 16th and I would need to rent a car for travel among the different locations.   I'd be turning in my rental and, if needed, checking out of my room here while gone, so that should effectively be a wash except for the airfare.

  You're probably poolside by now, and with this Friday and Monday being down days here, I doubt I'll see your reply until Tuesday, so perhaps you can consider it and let me know then, chief, or hit me up with any additional thoughts.

  Matt
