I'm not able to download this quickly right now or else I'd put it on vantage myself. This guy was our volunteer and he will try again with this tonight.

Here is how Jack described it. It's a pretty good bit.

"Sen. Cruz and I had a fairly tense exchange at the conclusion of the Lebanon event. I told him that I'm a gay christian and that I'd had the pleasure of meeting him at a diner in Plainfield earlier in the afternoon, explained that Gov. Pence had recently signed a law that would [allow] that same diner to refuse service to my boyfriend and I if we were to go there, and asked if he would still eat there if they did that. Essentially, he refused to answer my question. Frustrating and disheartening but I expected nothing less. Interesting that Pence says he wouldn't eat at a restaurant that denied service to a gay couple but Cruz won't say the same."
