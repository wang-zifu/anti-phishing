Gunmen from Al Shabwan and Abida tribes blew up a main oil export pipeline and attacked electricity lines twice in Mareb on Friday in retaliation for what they said was the killing of Sheikh Shayef al-Shabwani and two others in Sana’a last night.  The tribes said the dead man was a tribal sheikh and that the group was mistakenly identified.  The Security Committee said Shayef al-Shabwani was one of the “most dangerous” al-Qaeda commanders.
