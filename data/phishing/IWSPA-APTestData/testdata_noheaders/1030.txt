Dear User,

I hope you are well.

I know you are getting inundated with emails from people as the news gets
out that you are likely to help Secretary Clinton run for the White House.
If the news is true, I would love to help!  I have the time and ability to
manage a very significant part of Secretary Clinton’s fundraising effort.

Years ago, you were instrumental in launching my career in fundraising when
you placed me in the Leahy operation.  I would like to work with you
again.  Please let me know what I can do.

Can we meet up in the next month?  I look forward to talking to you soon –
and catching up on family as well!

Best,

Tina
