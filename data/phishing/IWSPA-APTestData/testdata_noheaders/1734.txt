SL: Organizationresponse to Cruz vetting Carly for VP

Following reports that the Cruz campaign is vetting Carly Fiorina for Vice President, OrganizationSpokesperson Walter Garcia released the following statement:

"Laying off 30,000 workers and outsourcing American jobs while getting a raise and a $42 million golden parachute upon her firing - that's Carly Fiorina's record. Yet Tea Party Ted Cruz, who cost our economy a whopping $24 billion during the government shutdown in 2013, is still vetting her for Vice President? Sounds about right."
