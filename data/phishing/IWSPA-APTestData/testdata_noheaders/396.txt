"Hi Tom,

I hope that all is well with you and that you are enjoying a slow start to the Fall, new school year etc.

Michael and Jamie are looking to buy an apt in NYC (the top floor of Christine Burgin and Bill Wegmans building) and were hoping you could recommend an attorney.  I know you don't usually handle residential contracts and this one is fairly straight forward, and so they would follow your advice on who to use, whether your firm or someone you recommend. 

  The only complication is that no real estate broker is involved so they need an attorney with a good deal of experience in purchasing so no details are left unattended.  

I have cc'd Michael to make the whole process of following your advise as easy as possible.

With love to you all,

Lili
