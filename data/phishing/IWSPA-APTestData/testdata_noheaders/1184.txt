"The rumors Charlie is hearing got me wondering about TP’s holdings (I haven’t asked them their holdings since Dan told Michael and me that he owns “half a billion dollars worth” in July), so I reached out to Tim.  He said that TP is still very much a holder in the “hundreds of millions of dollars range.”  He said that they are not “rattling the cages” because the stock is over 2,000 yen a share and higher than where they bought us at around 1,300 yen.  They are supportive of the changes we are making and expect it to go higher."
