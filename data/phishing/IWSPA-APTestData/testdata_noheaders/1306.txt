User,

Sean just asked if we hit our goal. We're actually really close. We need another $2,347 to get there. Unfortunately, we only have until midnight, so we're running out of time.

This deadline is huge, so Sean's getting anxious. I hate to ask, but could you help us out? You can contribute on this ActBlue page or give me a call at (845) 831-9110.

I really appreciate anything you can do.

Tim
