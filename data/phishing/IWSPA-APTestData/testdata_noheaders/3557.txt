"Think Like A Man Too Tracking - June 9th

Think Like A Man Too makes great gains across all measures today to land at 19% unaided (+4), 92% aware (+2), 68% definite interest (+2), and 24% first choice (+4). 

These gains are driven primarily by females, while the males seem to be more distracted by the other films in our competitive window. Against our comps, we have great unaided and awareness, and it’s heartening that first choice continues to grow, knowing all along that opening week is when we’ll really get to see that measure climb.
