Confidentially, I wanted to reach out to let you know that while I'm honored to be part of Priorities, I would be happy to flip to the campaign if needed.  
Here's where I think my skills could be helpful:  on the surrogate side, where I know she will have an enormous demand, I could be a surrogate to states, state dem parties (particularly if you need people in states or at times where she will not be able to campaign), make appearances on local or national media, meet with local electeds, listening to local dems, etc.  While Priorities' role is obviously key, I'd be happy to serve in any other role as well.  I'm pretty good at connecting with dems anywhere, getting them motivated, and message delivery.  
Just wanted to let you know, as you plug people into roles on the campaign side.  
Obviously I'm happy to be involved either way.
