Thanks for the update.  Glad you are well. If you can feel the small finger
tip touching the gauze around it when you move it a bit, it should be
fine. I'm fine with your pulling aside some gauze to look at it if you
want visual confirmation, but it was pink yesterday.   Feel free to call me
at 301-787-1040 with any questions or concerns.

Take care, Mustafa
