Hi User,

This just note is a quick note to your personal email, to give you the latest update on the Clinton Climate Initiative CEO search.  

No doubt you already know that in the end, Eric decided to go in another direction with a different candidate.  

It sounds like they found someone who is a very good fit, so I am pleased for CCI.

I was deeply gratified to have been a finalist for the position, and to have received serious consideration.

Thanks so much for your support and interest, and I will of course remain engaged in supporting how I can on strategy.  

Best,
Bracken
