We have our LCV board meeting in town in a couple of weeks, and it would be a very special treat if you could stop by for a half hour, either at the dinner on 3/18 or almost any time between 8:30 and 2:30 on 3/19. 
We could give you a proper thanks for your many years of service, and of course you could fill us in on our your latest adventure.
Of course I understand if it won't work, but it can't hurt to ask, and at least you are spending more time in town these days!
Thanks and keep up the great work.
