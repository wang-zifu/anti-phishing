Let me check with Ryan to see if he's doing a statement from DWS.

I can start wrangling speakers for a press call tomorrow. Need to target members who are on Judiciary and Education & Workforce in the House, and Judiciary and Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions in the Senate. I have a few folks in mind. Can someone help me with a possible script?
