"It's Time for a Birthday Lunch!

Hi Leah,

I can’t believe so many months have gone by already, but now that it is June, it’s your birthday month. Let’s find a time for us to celebrate. I can schedule with Bobbie if that’s easier. Hope all is well on the organization front and at home.

Take care,

Barbara
