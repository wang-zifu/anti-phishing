Georgetown Law’s very own Paul Butler will be the presenter at the faculty workshop tomorrow, Feb. 9th, at 12:10 in the Faculty Dining Room.  Lunch will be served starting at noon.  Paul’s paper on The Limits of Criminal Justice Reform is attached; it should also be available in hard copy at the faculty assistant stations.

Best,

Adam
