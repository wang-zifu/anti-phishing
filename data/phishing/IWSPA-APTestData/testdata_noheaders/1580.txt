User,

I wanted to personally share the news.

With just 8 hours to go until the deadline, we're only $3,251 short of hitting $125,000 for August and setting a new online record for this election!

That's an incredible showing, and it's all because of your incredible support. Thanks!

But User, we're not there yet.

So what do you say? Join the party and chip in a few dollars before midnight.

Thanks for your help!
