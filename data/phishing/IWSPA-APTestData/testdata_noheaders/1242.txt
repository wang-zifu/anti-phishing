Dear User user,

Due to our great friendship with you, we here at the Turkic American
Alliance have specially designed an Ebru painting or water marbling to
show our appreciation for your continues support for our organization
through attendance to our conventions and TAA events. Ebru is a
traditional Islamic Turkish form of painting. To achieve this style of
art, it must be painted on water and then transferring this painting onto
paper going it a beautiful marbling effect. The President of Turkic
American Alliance, Dr. Faruk Taban would like to personally present this
painting to you.

We would like to request a meeting to personally deliver the artwork to
you. Please let me know when the best time for your office. We look
forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,

Hatice Kubra Ogden
Project Assistant
Turkic American Alliance
