Really like those, Dan.
Some small things:
1.This is a call for Mike and Harrell, but does she need to mention
having CSPs support?  And maybe I missed it but does she need to say
something abt electing Dems up and down the ticket in NH.  Maggie,
CSP, winning the Exec Council, Gov, House, Senate--you thank them for
their work but do we need to touch on winning races.  Again, defer to
Mike and Harrell on all this.
2. In the national security section, I think we need to have a stock
line she uses whenever we touch on national security that ISIS needs
to be destroyed.  I think it's important to stay on the record on
that.
3.  Does she need to address the PP attack in Co?
