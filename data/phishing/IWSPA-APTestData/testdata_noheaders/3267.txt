Okay -

I also put some thoughts on the questions below in red. Obviously, you shou=
ld play with the specific language you'd like to use if you want to go back=
 to him with more. I think the point that there is a lot of HVF money alloc=
ated to states that hasn't been sent to them yet  because it is for general=
 election purposes is a good one, and the reason that they're sending money=
 to us so far is because we are building the infrastructure that is necessa=
ry to support the programs that they will be running later.

Of course, if you want to go back to him with more of the below, may want t=
o coordinated/check with HFA to make sure we're on the same page and saying=
 the same things.

Thanks,

Graham
