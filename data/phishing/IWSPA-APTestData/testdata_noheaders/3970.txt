Dear valued eBay member, 

During our regular=
ly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, we have dete=
cted a slight error in your billing information. 

This might be due=
 to either of the following reasons: 

1. A recent change in your pe=
rsonal information ( i.e.change of address). 
2. Submiting invalid info=
rmation during the initial sign up process. 
3. An inability to accurat=
ely verify your selected option of payment due to an internal error within=
 our processors. 

Once you have updated your account records your e=
Bay session will not be interrupted and will 
continue as normal.

ormation is not updated within 48 hours then your ability to use eBay will=
