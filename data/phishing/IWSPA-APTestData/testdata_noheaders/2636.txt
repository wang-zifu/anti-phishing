Houthis have asked all residents of Sana'a to go up on the roofs of

  their homes or nearby buildings and shout four sentences (below) in

  unison at 9:00PM tonight.

  It is hoped that this event will show that they are everywhere in the

  city.  It is expected to be simulcast from mosque loudspeakers, as well

  as on 99.1 fm, a Houthi affiliated radio station, and throughout the

  city via cars with loudspeakers.  Microphones has been distributed

  across town for this purpose.

  The chant at nine pm is as follows:

  1-    Allah Akbar, death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the

  Jews, victory to Isalm. (Repeat three times)

  2-    The people want to topple the government. (Repeat three times)

  3-    The people want to cancel the ‘dose’ (increase of fuel price).

  (Repeat three times)

  4-    The people want the implementation of the NDC outcomes. (Repeat

  three times)
