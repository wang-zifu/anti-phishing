User -

I hope all is well with you. I tried to call you today, but apparently the number I had for you is inoperative.

I wanted to speak with you briefly re: Greece - given the restrictions on the ELA lending to the Greek banks, the financial (and thus civil/political) system may dissolve quickly.

I know that you are very busy, but if you have a moment, I can be reached at 916-919-1177.

Eryn -

For future reference, what is the best number to reach User or to leave a message? - if via you/your number, that's more than fine.

Thanks.

Phil
