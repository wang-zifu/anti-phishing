Dear Faculty and Deans,

I write to invite you to the annual Part-time Student Reception, which will be held on Tuesday, September 23rd from 7:45pm - 9:00pm in the McDonough 3rd Floor atrium.  Hosted by the Office of the Dean of Students, The Office of Student Life and the Student Bar Association, this gathering provides our first year part-time students a great opportunity to mingle with faculty, administrators and their upperclass peers in an informal setting.  I hope you will stop by to say hello, especially if you are teaching first years in the part time program this year.

If you plan to attend, an RSVP would be appreciated.  Please email Beverly Sapp at user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>.

Best,
Mitch
