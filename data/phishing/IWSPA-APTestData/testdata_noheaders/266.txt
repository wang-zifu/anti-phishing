OrganizationChair Statement on Republican Senator Admitting Senate Republicans Should do Their Job on Supreme Court

WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on Senator Jeff Flake's comments this weekend on Meet the Press that if Republicans lose the presidential election they "ought to approve [Chief Judge Garland] quickly:"

"Senator Flake's comments are a reminder that Republicans are playing political games with the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is the most qualified nominee to immediately serve on the Supreme Court, with more federal judicial experience than any other nominee in history, he should get a fair hearing and a vote. That the GOP has nominated a reckless and dangerous candidate in Donald Trump who lacks the temperament and judgment to serve -- much less appoint a Supreme Court justice -- should be enough for Republicans in the Senate to do their job now, not recklessly leave a Supreme Court seat unfilled until November."
