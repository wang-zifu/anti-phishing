Hi User,

My User is Lisa Hagen, and I'm a campaign reporter with The Hill newspaper
in Washington. I reached out to both you and Mark yesterday and was hoping
I could talk to one of you about the fallout from the Nevada convention and
the back-and-forth between Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz and the Sanders
campaign. I wanted to give you guys a chance to respond and be included in
the story. If you can email or call me back as soon as possible, that'd be
greatly appreciated. My contact info is below in my signature. Thanks in
advance!
