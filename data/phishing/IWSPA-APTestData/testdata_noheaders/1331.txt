  Houthi yellow card with civil disobedience instructions on it

  distributed today. Poster says

  “ Don’t forget.. Civil disobedience will grant you a better future. Dear

  brother. Dear sister. If authorities didn’t respond to the people’s

  demands, civil disobedience is a powerful and peaceful tool to those who

  don’t meet public demands.

  Civil disobedience .Stop paying bills.. Don’t deal with the police.

  Don’t deal with courts… Gov employees stay at home. Don’t worry from

  civil disobedience because it’s for you and your kids. Prosperous life

  will not exist if you decided not to stand against the injustice and

  corruption.
