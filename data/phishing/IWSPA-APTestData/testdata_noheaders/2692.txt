I'm glad you got to ride on the big plane. That was my goodbye gift. It all seemed to go well and I'm glad my home town finally has a National Park. Local Hawaii press looked great. Colorado seemed fine save for the pissy Congressman. Lots more to do and I'm glad you are there to make up big difference.  Don't hesitate to call.

It was an amazing week, and I sure missed having you there to share in the win. I even heard that Jimmy Fallon talked about Every Kid in his monologue. Your ideas and motivation continue in your absence.
