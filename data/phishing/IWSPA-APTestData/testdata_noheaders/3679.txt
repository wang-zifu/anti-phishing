"[MESA] Inside a Flawed Spy Machine as Gadhafi's Rule Crumbled   This looks like an interesting article can anyone access it and send out   then?   <<link>>  BY CHARLES LEVINSON AND MARGARET COKER   TRIPOLI, Libya-Reams of confidential documents reveal mounting desperation   and disarray among top leaders of Col. Moammar Gadhafi's regime this past   spring as power slipped through their fingers.   The files, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, were discovered in the   office of Libya's spy chief and two other security agencies after the   personnel fled their desks as civil war deepened. The documents expose an   ossified culture within Libya's police state that proved largely incapable   of switching gears to fight an actual war. Propaganda skills failed to   translate into battlefield analysis, leaving soldiers furious and, in some   cases, surprisingly clueless. -- Benjamin Preisler +216 22 73",
