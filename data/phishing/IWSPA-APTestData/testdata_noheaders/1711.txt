User - I don't think you need to do anything with this memo but HR and Legal put it together so we could document the steps we took to deal with complaints we got re: WCEG HR matters.  I think things have stabilized.  But when we last talked about it you indicated a desire to have it for your files so forwarding it to you.  Happy to discuss if helpful.  Thanks, Carmel
