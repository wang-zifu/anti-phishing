"[alpha] INSIGHT - company - update on Saleh being a little bitch -	YN301   SOURCE: YN301   ATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR source   SOURCE DESCRIPTION: companyi diplomat buddy of mine   PUBLICATION: Yes   SOURCE RELIABILITY: B   ITEM CREDIBILITY: B   SPECIAL HANDLING: Alpha   SOURCE HANDLER: Reva   Nothing new in Saleh's speech. He's insisting on staying on as president.   What he said about transferring power to the VP was just referring to the   powers he already transferred (VP and Saleh's son are running the show in   Sanaa.)  Designed to confuse, while still not making any real   concessions.  I don't know if he is seriously coming back this time..he's   keeping everyone in the dark on this, nobody knows what he wants. If i   hear of any serious sign of him coming back, ill call u.   Saudis still need to figure out what they want - they're totally divided   on how to deal with company, payments to the tribes on both sides   continuing.",
