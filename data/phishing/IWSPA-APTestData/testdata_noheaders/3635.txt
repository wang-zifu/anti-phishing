"   Andy, Gerry:  note Mike's ANGLICO background in the 72' period.  I've   invited him to the Ennis reunion but am traveling and don't have an   electronic copy of the flyer with me.  Could either of you send him an   electronic copy?        Gerry,  how is Bunny doing and are you back in Virginia yet?

I was in touch with Don Price several years     ago, and he invited me to the last Covan reunion, which I was unable to     attend. I might really try to make an effort to go to this one. Don did     bring me up to date on a number of the advisors, including all you     mentioned. Please send me info on the reunion if you have it.
