So far MSNBC has requested DWS for today, tomorrow, and Friday to do a hit on LIVE with Thomas Roberts in the 1pm or 2pm hour. Sadly, her schedule has not yet permitted locking in a booking.

MSNBC also reached out and booked User for a 3:15 hit with Kate Snow.

MSNBC POC reaching out to us on each of these hits has been Amy Shuster.

All the above requests for Organizationtalkers have come from MSNBC in the last 24 hours.

Thanks!
