Ok, this has gone too far. The email below is from Craig to Nick to me where someone knows an interview with Andrea was on the table. Seperately, Andrea just sent Nick this: ""we are hearing news conference tomorrow?""

‎The Andrea part especially should only have been known to 10-12 people, 3 of whom are User, Cheryl & me.
