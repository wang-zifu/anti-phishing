btw, my sentiments about the gangs are not driven by the incident at USC as much as by what is happening in Chicago. as you know, I’ve been mentoring 3 boys for 3 years.. I’ve gotten them to go back to school, I got them into Catholic Charity housing, I bailed them out of jail, and went to court (7 times) took them to the doctor, the dentist, got them jobs, and took them out for ice cream.. but when I went to school today to confirm my suspicions that Jordan wasn’t really attending class, and found him outside of the school stoned out of his mind, I realized I cannot compete with the gangs and the drugs. they are destroying our cities and killing our kids.
