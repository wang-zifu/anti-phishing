User,

In Arizona, we tell it like it is.

So this is me, reaching out to you, saying: We NEED to hit our FEC goal. Give what you can today.

I've never been afraid to get some mud on my boots, but things may get a little too messy if we don't hit this deadline. User McCain is already admitting this is going to be his toughest election yet, and the National Journal confirmed I'm ""the toughest gen­er­al-elec­tion chal­lenger Mc­Cain has ever faced.""

And they're right. We're getting stronger every day for the fight ahead. With your help, we'll have the resources necessary to spread our message to all corners of Arizona.

We don't want to enter the new year behind on our fundraising goals.

That's why I'm counting on folks like you to help power my campaign into 2016. Donate $5 or $10 today to help hit this critical FEC goal.

Thank you,

Ann----
