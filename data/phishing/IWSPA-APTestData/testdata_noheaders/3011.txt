What i don't like about Bernie is that he has hardly anything good to say about America. He sounds like Trump. America is in such bad shape.

But America has strongest economy in the world, best schools in the world, best hospitals in the world, best science and technology in the world. Capitalism works. We are not a socialist society. Although  every system needs checks and balances. Wall Street is the engine that runs our economy. Its not all bad. Even fire can be destructive if its mishandledâ€¦ but properly controlled, we can't be productive without it.
