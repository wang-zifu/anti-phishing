"FW: Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs2- Opening shows- France

I missed this one this morning.   Strong news, puts us on track to equal or exceed our number and the local film that everyone feared on our weekend is well behind us (we are going “toe to toe” with a local animated that opened last weekend (but again, nowhere near the competition the local films were over Xmas).

Will send good news out now.
