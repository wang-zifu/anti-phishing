User,
Just left you a msg.  We are trying to get the MD delegation rolled out
this week to create a little friction for O'Malley out of the gate.  Don't
want to rub it in his face, but want to make things a little uncomfortable.

Hoyer is on board and helping, but BAM isn't willing to move.  Worried
staff might be gumming things up.  Would you be willing to call her
tomorrow and ask for her if we can get folks rolled out now?  Hoyer is
already public so it's strange for her to hold her fire.
