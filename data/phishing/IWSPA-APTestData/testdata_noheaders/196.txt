Sir,

  Thank you for your patience.  The Chief and I had the opportunity to confer with our Front Office leadership regarding your team's domain.com request.  Simply put, Post cannot support the domain.com and recommends a SVTC as an alternative to visiting company.  This simply boils down to the ever shifting security situation and boots on ground restrictions informed by lodging, vehicle and security support limitations.  The Embassy has a planned security upgrades project which will shortly commence.  This project is Post's priority and requires each Section to domain.com in-country visits.  The project is scheduled to last until the beginning of next year, if not longer.  During this time, visits have to be kept a minimum.

  Please accept my sincerest apologies for not getting back to you sooner.  I am hopeful that while an in-country domain.com is not possible, a SVTC during the 24-28 Aug timeframe will help address the questions and information your team seeks regarding the 1206 program in company.  OM
