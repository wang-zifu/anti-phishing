Many of you may have heard the terribly sad news that Evelyn Lieberman
passed away last night.  It is beyond comprehension and I am so deeply
sad.  For those who would like to sit shiva, it will be tomorrow and
Tuesday from 5-8pm at the Lieberman residence - 3216 Newark St, NW
Details on memorial service will be forthcoming.
