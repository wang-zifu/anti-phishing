Would like to speak today or tomorrow.

Marlon said that it's *not* necessary for you to take this call. According
to him the Reverend is being difficult about a Ministers meeting, and *IF*
you want to call him, you should first talk to Marlon, who can give you the
full background.

Marlon: 913-515-7308

Rev Sharpton: 917-658-0305
