User,
1.  No problem with CAP Tawfic effort being separate, I just thought what Tawfic has asked us to do in March might be helpful.  
2.  Father Alex and our biggest contributors and bundlers (Kounalakis, Tsunis, Mehiel, Chanos, etc.) would like to touch base with you at a short meeting in the relatively near future (other than this week) in Washington or Brooklyn to get our community's serious fund raising rolling.
