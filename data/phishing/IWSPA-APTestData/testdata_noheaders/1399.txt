I'm selling, either separately or combined, my Solid Pine L-Shape Bunk Bed Set with matching dresser & bookcase.

The entire lot currently retails for $3,230.  Willing to let it all go for $675 (or best offer).  Individual pricing on attached flyers.  Please let me know if you are interested.  Willing to consider all offers.

Hurry!  I want to give my neighbors & co-workers first dibs, after that, it goes on Craig's List.
