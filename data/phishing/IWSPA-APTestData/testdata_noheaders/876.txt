Mr. Userg,

Thank you for your response. Depending upon where your speech will be, I am
hoping to travel there from Union, New Jersey. I am rather interested in the
ULTRA and MAGIC decrypts, especially since the domain.com that I have been writing
about - Sturmstaffel 1 - is mentioned in several of the messages, two of which I
have been able to obtain from the PRO.

At present, I am very interested in speaking with you about General der Flieger
Ulrich Kessler whose Soldbuch I recently acquired from his interrogator. Through
your book GOERING, I saw that you had contact with Kessler's son, Hans-Joachim
Kessler, and was hoping to obtain his contact information from you. I am having
dinner in Union, NJ, with two old friends on Friday, but was hoping that I might
be able to meet with you briefly after the speech. If necessary, I will gladly
pay your fee for attendance even though I would not be able to arrive in time
for your speech.

I will look forward to hearing from you as your time permits.

Regards,

Barry

P.S. Incidentally, we met in Baltimore, MD, and Monroeville, PA, at the MAX
Shows.
