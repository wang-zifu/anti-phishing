Hi User - We went live today with our piece on the continued viability  
of the independent groups (links below).  Just got off a call with  
Anna Ekindjian from America Votes and Amy Dacey talking through a  
coordinated approach to fundraising.  If you have some time, I'd like  
to get a sense from you of what meetings you have planned or want to  
set up, etc.  Plus, I could use some background on Mary Pat Bonner's  
role in all this.

The top priority it seems to me is to sit down with Steve Bing and see  
just what he wants to do.  If you and I could do that meeting  
together, that would be ideal.

I've got a 3 day DA retreat starting today, but i could do calls early  
morning each of the next two days.

Thanks,
Steve

Here's the HuffPo piece and Ben Smith picking up on it:
