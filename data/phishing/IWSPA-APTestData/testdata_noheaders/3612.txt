Another potential WH staffer is Darcy Burner, who narrowly lost her
congressional bid to Reichart in WA-8. From what I understand, she has a
very solid relationship with Rahm, and is truly beloved by the netroots
and other elements of the progressive community. She doesn't know DC
politics, but would be a great asset with the netroots and others.
