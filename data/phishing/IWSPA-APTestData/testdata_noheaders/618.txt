Amy --

I just spoke at the memorial service for Gerardo Hernandez, the TSA Agent who gave his life in the line of duty at LAX. Regrettably, families across Los Angeles face tragedy all too often and while you may think you can't help, little things can make a difference.

Find out where you can donateIt can be as simple as donating a teddy bear.

The aftermath of a crime or fire is chaotic and confusing. Children are often the most impacted. To help our police officers and firefighters focus on the crisis at hand, the all-volunteer Crisis Response Team is there to help those affected. 

One way they help is by giving stuffed animals to children at emergency scenes. To support their efforts, my office is launching a Teddy Bear Drive."
