Hello User,

One late addition to our agenda - Bridget, with Eryn's help pulled out these tasks from all the notes and memos on fundraising ""next steps"". Let's set aside some time for next steps on these and what you need in terms of prep.

I'll note that you'll receive a memo on the DINA early next week. I want User Schmitt - the new Research Director - to have a chance to weigh in this week.

Best,
Heather
