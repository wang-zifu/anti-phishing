Team, thanks for the good feedback on the econ speech. Latest draft is
attached.  You'll see that the top is revised in line with User and Joel's
suggestions, and that each of the buckets are refocused in a way that
hopefully makes them clearer.  More cutting and refining to do here for
sure, so please send me your thoughts.
Thanks
Dan
