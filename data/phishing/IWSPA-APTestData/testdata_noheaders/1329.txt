From everything I have heard I believe this story got the Monday speech the most
correct, and believe it is a huge mistake.  It is not about left versus center left versus
right.  It is about her being, and being seen as, a corporatist Democrat unwilling to
lead or challenge the institutional forces that create economic inequality and discontent.  I will domain.com to hear the final speech but User, I hope I am wrong but
doubt that I am, and if I am half-right about this, remember where you heard
it...... Brent
