User - 

Sorry to have to email tonight -- I hope you don't have to be working on the long weekend. I wouldn't email, but Maura and I are trying to close the books on August and we're a few bucks ($3,962) short.

We've got 65 days until the election, and frankly, if we don't put more resources (mailers, ads, canvassers, etc.) on the ground this week, we're going to lose on November 4th. I don't know about you, but I can't stand the idea of Boehner having ANOTHER vote in Washington -- can you chip in? Here's the link: <<link>>,500,1000,2500,2600 

Thanks, User.

Sean
