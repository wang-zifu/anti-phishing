    Why did you tell me last night you would be fine with me spending the
evening with my friend if you knew we were going to have to leave
immediately after the function to go to Richmond?

I have and had no idea where your friend lives. Is this the shooter friend? You
do not always tell me your plans in detail. We can change things around. So far
your friends do not seem to me to be worth much upheaval however. You probably
think the same about mine. As for your more unhelpful and hostile messages: "Get
over it." I have been working since 6 a.m. this morning trying to catch up and
plug holes you have left, e.g., by not bothering to inform me the Sala Thai no
longer exists.
