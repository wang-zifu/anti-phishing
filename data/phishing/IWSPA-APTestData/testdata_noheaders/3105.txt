Hey friends-it's my birthday<<>> on Tuesday, and I'd like you to celebrate it with me! We'll meet somewhere on Barracks row at 6:30pm, bar TBD. I know there are primaries on Tuesday so a lot of you folks will have to work, but stop by for a quick drink if you can.

I'll circle back next week and let you know the bar. I know I missed some people, so know that anyone is invited. Hope you can make it!

Rachel
