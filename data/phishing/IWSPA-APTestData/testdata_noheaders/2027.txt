Team,

Attached please find an oped on HRCâ€™s forthcoming policy to help coal
communities in the face of the massive transition in the energy sector. The
intention is to roll out the policy as soon as Monday and to place this
oped in a local outlet early in the week as well. *Please send comments and
edits by 5pm today* so this can go up to HRC tonight with the fact sheet.

Thanks,

Kristina
