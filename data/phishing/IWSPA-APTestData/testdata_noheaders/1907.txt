All - not surprisingly, we've received a number of follow up questions asking for confirmation of the Algeria donation. We could let it sit or confirm for other outlets with the following draft statement:

""Immediately following the devastating earthquake in Haiti January 12, 2010, the Embassy of Algeria made an unsolicited donation of $500K to Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief fund. As the Clinton Foundation did with all donations it received for Haiti, the entire amount of Algeria's contribution was distributed as aid. This donation was disclosed publicly on our website, however, the State Department should have also been formally informed. This was a one-time, specific donation for Haiti relief and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since.""
