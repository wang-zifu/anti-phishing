1.            financial disclosure issues have been worked out
2.            PE and HRC are in good substantive conversations
3.            it's all but a done deal
4.            there will be no formal announcement before thanksgiving
5.            the full national security team is still being worked out

HRC  to stick to  - we are in good substantive conversations,
any conversations I'm having are private, and I'm not going to comment any further
