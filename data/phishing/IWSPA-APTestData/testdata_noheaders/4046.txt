Calling All Wildcats!  It's time to grab those sneakers and get going!
This month is all about YOU. Try to out-step yourself, doing the activities you enjoy most. Elliptical your thing? Stay on a little longer. Evening walks? Go a little further. Whatever you do, just do more! 30 minutes of activity per day is the recommended amount to help you significantly reduce your risk of developing diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain kinds of cancer.
Sign up today for the UNH Wellness Challenge activity tracking and reporting website and challenge your coworkers to activity based challenges to win prizes and secure bragging rights across the organization.
