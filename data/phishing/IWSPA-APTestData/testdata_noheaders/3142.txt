"Just like Trump bashes China and Mexico despite making his clothing line there, he also bashes companies for media attention despite investing in them for his own personal gain. This is no different than Trump's plan to vet his running mate's tax returns but refuse to release his own. Donald Trump can't be trusted to lead and lacks the temperament to sit in the Oval Office." - OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach
