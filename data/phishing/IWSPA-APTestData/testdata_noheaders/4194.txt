Dear Wells Fargo  valued member, 
Due to concerns we have for the safety and integrity of 
    the Wells Fargo

    community we have issued this message. 
It has come to our attention that your Wells Fargo account 
    information needs to be updated.

    If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and 
    update your

    records you will not run into any future problems with the online service.

    However, failure to update your records will result in account suspension.

Once you have updated your account records your Wells 
    Fargo will not be

    interrupted and will continue as normal. 

    Please follow the link below and update your account information.
