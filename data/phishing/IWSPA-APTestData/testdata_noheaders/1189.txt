Dear User,
I meant to write much earlier. It was wonderful meeting you at the AAPI tech entrepreneurs meeting in Palo Alto a few weeks back. I was tied up with business travel to South Asia, and since returning have been focused on the launch of the AAPI Victory Fund -- Asian American voter mobilization effort --
in partnership with Shekar. 

Many congrats on an awesome win in NV. Look forward to collaborating on behalf of our communities in the months to come. 

Please do let me know if there is anything I can do to help. 

Best,

Dilawar
