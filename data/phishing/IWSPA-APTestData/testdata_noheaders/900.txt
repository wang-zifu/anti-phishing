"Friend  -- 

This  won’t take too long: Tuesday at midnight marks the end of the fiscal quarter.  This is a big deal for Democrats all across the country – because it’s the last  FEC filing deadline until Election Day.

Your  grassroots support is critical to ensuring that I can continue fighting for you  in Congress.

In  addition, a small group of donors have offered to MATCH every single donation  that comes through the door until the end of the month -- but ONLY if we can  get 200 grassroots supporters to step up before tomorrow night!

This  is an amazing opportunity, but I can’t do it without committed grassroots  supporters like you. Click  here to unlock the match now >>

Thanks  so much,

Janice
