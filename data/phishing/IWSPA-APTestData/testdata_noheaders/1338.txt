I know you guys haven't heard from me in a while, but Jess and I have been =
trying to move the ball forward without much success.

Enclosed is our update:

Sanders:  I have been in touch with Sanders telling them we would like to w=
ork with them to schedule a DNC-sponsored debate.  Mark Longabaugh responde=
d with the following last week:  "Erik, let me get with the team and discus=
s.  Thanks for reaching out.  Best, Mark"

Clinton:  Charlie told me the Clinton position is they will not participate=
 in any debate without Organizationsponsorship.  They want the May debate to be sch=
eduled and coordinated by the DNC.  I have not shared that with Sanders cam=
p yet, I'm waiting on them to come back after they discuss internally.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

Erik
