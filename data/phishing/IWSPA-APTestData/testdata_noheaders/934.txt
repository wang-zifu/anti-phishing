Dear Friends, 

As the midterm elections near and the partisan rhetoric escalates, I hope you've saved the date for Politics Aside 2014.

We'll kick off with a cocktail reception and light dinner at the organization Pictures Studios on Thursday, November 13, and continue on Friday, November 14, with a full day of engaging discussions at RAND's headquarters campus in Santa Monica.

We're excited about this year's program, which will explore the policies and ideas shaping our world. Among our confirmed speakers are Sheila Bair, Nicolas Berggruen, Susan Dentzer, Kenneth Feinberg, David Goldhill, Michael Leiter, Saad Mohseni, Judith Rodin, Naguib Sawiris, and Simon Sinek. You can see more by visiting the 

website and we will send you updates on the program as we draw closer to the event.

Politics Aside is intimate by design, and the number of participants is limited to encourage max"
