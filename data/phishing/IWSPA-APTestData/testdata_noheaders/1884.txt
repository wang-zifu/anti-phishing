Mr. P,

Given the results from Tuesday, I thought your press conference presentation--words, tone, body language, teasing w reporters and occasional flashes of your smile-- was right on target. What is not apparent to me is whether it was like the proverbial duck--smoothly sailing on the surface while paddling like crazy below as you assess and strategize the way forward. I'm always available to you to discuss any and all matters if I can be helpful to you. 

On china, I know you'll be in Beijng next week, so am sending a news report about how Xi's official party on its domain.com to Tanzania loaded up their planes w poached ivory, likely w full knowledge of Kikwete's government. 

Please raise this issue directly w XI, both because it is critical on the merits but also because it's another way you can gain some leverage with the Chinese. I'm happy to discuss this with the White House team.
