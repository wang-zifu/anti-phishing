Zac is okay with the focus on House and Senate Republicans being bad on infrastructure and guns.

He just doesn't want to link the House and Senate Republicans to Trump.

His broader point: the campaign does not want to connect Trump and the Republican Party. They want to make Trump look even more extreme than the rank-and-file Republican Member of Congress. Otherwise, in their mind, Trump will come across as less scary than he really is.

Thoughts?
