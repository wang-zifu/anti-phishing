  SAN'A, companyâ€”Witnesses to the fatal shootings last month of two companyis by American government officials said they saw a Western-looking man pull a gun from his belt and shoot both companyis dead during what appeared to be a kidnapping attempt at a barber shop.

The U.S. officials have left the country, according to the State Department.
