Kevin,

  Here are the highlights:

  * All company ""Backup Training Bases"" are off the table-inadequate security and infrastructure-in country plan will focus on Sana'a only. Not sure what this means….will Seabird training ONLY occur in Sana’a?  In previous SEPCOR, training in “other-than Sana’a” was discussed due to the Capital’s high altitude and aircraft capability limitations…

  * Site Survey: will likely target the third week in Dec as earliest opportunity

  Site survey domain.com.  Timing for 3rd week of December may not be feasible.  Rationale: COL R TDY from 30 Nov – 5 Dec timeframe for Strat Dialogue in DC.  He will also be TDY for third round of YQBT from 15-20 December (assuming he doesn’t take leave in GE following conference.  I am requesting 3 weeks of leave from 19 Dec to 6 Jan (this is the price I paid with the Mrs for extending a year.  )

  * LTC Maynard (DSCA) offered to assist with coordination of Visas by working with the company Embassy here in DC directly-looking for passport info today of attendees-in work.  How many and for what purpose?  Bottom line, I ask that appropriate personnel prepare a one page summary (5 W’s) as to reason for visiting company.  This will help COL R, really me, to coordinate request with Front Office.  Summary should also include a listing of ALL the places that the team requests to domain.com.

  * Question came up: will you plan on joining as the NAVAIR rep?

  * Side-note (not discussed on call): I will be sending out a separate note today regarding a backup plan should we not be able to get into country

  * Short discussion of the need to domain.com with YCAMA.  The preference is that we can work airworthiness certification through the YAF directly as a military aircraft.  That will streamline coordination. This will need to be discussed with the YAF directly. Note: does this approach track with your previous experience (CASA?)?  During 3 Nov meeting, COL Abdulmalik said airworthiness certification will be signed  by YCAMA not YAF.

  * Regarding Action Item #3,  the ""Out of company training contingency plan"" I introduced using the Seabird Australia location to minimize cost and schedule impact. One question came up about non-English speaking pilots flying in AU airspace which I agreed to investigate. Upon further discussion with the team we realized that the pilots will always be flying with an English speaking IP, so it should not be a showstopper but we are investigating so we understand the domain.com requirements. We are working that ROM and this contingency will be one of the discussion items at the Seabird Site domain.com. Please confirm whether or not YAF pilots and maintainers require English training.  This could be a huge bump in the road if so.  Hopefully training will be accomplished purely in Arabic as stated in the LOA.  How would this training be paid?  Is it possible funding may requiring reducing other case lines to support?

  * Justin is working the Harris delivery schedule and indicated radios are ready now. I will be providing him delivery specifics this afternoon

  * For delivery to Australia, there will be an ITAR clearance to coordinate-Brad Brigante will provide advice from KIG TS,  but we will need a Gov lead as it is GFE.

  * Regarding aircraft delivery, for physical security purposes in minimizing road exposure from the port to Sana'a we will plan on delivering the aircraft to the Port of Hudaydah---the closest port to Sana'a. Copy, Seabirds will arrive via Surface shipment to port of Hodeidah.

  * Regarding Action Item 15.1, TASE software fairly intuitive and icon based.  Our sense is that the sensor operator does not need to be English proficient to operate the TASE.  Awaiting feedback from OMC regarding feedback on the Harris system from the Harris in country rep. In SEPCOR, I believe Russ Partridge said that KIG owns responsibility to train Yems on equipment. Rather than putting OMC in the middle, I ask the community reach out directly to Harris to resolve this question and provide response to OMC.

  * Brief discussion on training letter-feedback from government team emphasizing importance of letter from the contractor-letter forwarded Friday night under Brad's signature. Letter was formally submitted to YAF/CC and MoD CoS on 3 Nov 2015…requested a suspense of 15 November (see attached).

  For all on the cc line, please pitch in with any corrections/additions.

  Hope all had a great weekend!

  V/R,

  Vinnie
