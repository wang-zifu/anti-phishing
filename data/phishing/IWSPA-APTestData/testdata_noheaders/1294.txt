Hello Mr. user,

I am contacting you because I recently read you are doing recruitment for the Hillary Clinton campaign to be announced shortly.  I hope you donâ€™t mind this assertive communication, but I wanted to make a connection with someone from the campaign.  I would love nothing more than to secure a win for Mrs. Clinton.  I have nearly a decade of experience in campaign organizing, fundraising, and legislative advocacy having been one of the leaders of the gay rights movement in California and nationally.  I currently serve as the Vice President of the National Board of Directors for Marriage Equality USA.  I am attaching a cover letter, CV, and several letters of recommendation to this email for your review.  I greatly appreciate your time in reading this email and reviewing these materials, and I truly hope to hear back from you.  

Best Regards,
Brandon Brawner
