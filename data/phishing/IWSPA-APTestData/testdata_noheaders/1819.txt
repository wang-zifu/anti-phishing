Hi User-two things, I haven't heard back from you re Sierra Club-I am
meeting with Carl Pope on weds afternoon here in SF so any thoughts you
have I would greatly appreciate.  I meet with full board next week.
Second, Bruce Bodaken, CEO of California Blue Shield will be in DC next
week and would love to domain.com with you-I will check with your scheduler,
but I thought I would give you a heads up on the request.  Blue Shield
has been a supporter of CAP and I think they were looking for a little
face time, given the house vote on health care over the weekend.  Best,
Maria
