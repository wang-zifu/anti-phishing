Hi Steve,

Hope everything is going well.

I just wanted to let you know that some of SNEI members (Aragon and Video Unlimited team, and Benefield and Biz Dev team) will be attending the “Taste for a Cure” event tomorrow on behalf of me to celebrate you being honored. Unfortunately as I am in Tokyo this week I cannot join the event with my team to celebrate you. (Congrats in advance Steve!)

Also wanted to express my feeling how we are excited about our PS Original Project working together with your team.

We are having fun working together and hoping to make our users have fun thru the original content!

Again, congrats for tomorrow night event and have fun!
