hey guys -

I'm working on a story about Sen. Sanders's comments yesterday about the
contested convention.

I've seen Mrs. Wasserman Schultz say it's great that Sanders plans to stay
in until all the votes are counted. But he's talking about contesting this
thing on the floor, even if Clinton has more pledged delegates.

Any thoughts you can give me on the record or on background about this? And
what if Clinton does need super-delegates to put her over the top at the
convention? Should it all be fair game until then?

Thanks,
