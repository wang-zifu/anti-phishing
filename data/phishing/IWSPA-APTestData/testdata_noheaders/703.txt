Hi Anthony:

The miles are in the account and the record is set up for ticketing.  There was a $10.00 tax charge which I put on the same MasterCard that you used to buy the miles.  American said it may take 24 hours to be ticketed but when it is done, they will email to your Mom’s email address.

So you are all set

Hugs
