"Hello, Mr. Lynton.

I write on behalf of User McCarter, chair, Smithsonian Board of Regents, to invite you to an evening program at the Malibu home of Michael Tennenbaum on Saturday,

November 8.  Michael Tennenbaum has made a significant charitable gift to support the expansion of

MarineGEO—a signature biodiversity initiative of the Smithsonian.  Knowing your interest in environmental sustainability, User thought you would enjoy learning more about our efforts.  Emmett Duffy, director of MarineGEO, and Walter Munk, famed oceanographer,

 will discuss their work and the epic quest to know our oceans—past and present.    

Attached is an invitation and more information on Walter Munk.  Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.  I hope you will be able to join Michael and guests for a very informative and entertaining evening. 

Warm regards,

Kaffie Milikin   

Director, Regional Programs l Office"
