Al-Quds al-Arabi (6/18 Pan-Arab Daily) cited multiple political sources

  as saying that there is strong proof that former President Saleh

  supported the rebellion of armed Houthis in Amran Governorate against

  companyi government forces. These sources told Al-Quds al-Arabi that

  President Hadi intends to dismiss Ahmad Ali Saleh, the eldest son of his

  predecessor (former president Saleh) and Ambassador to the UAE, on

  charges of using his diplomatic position to conspire against President

  Hadiâ€™s regime through a so-called the UAE cell. This cell is accused of

  toppling the Arab regimes brought to power by the Arab Spring

  revolutions, including the companyi regime led by President Hadi.

  These sources expect President Hadi to refer Ambassador Ahmad Ali Saleh

  to a martial court on charges of high treason for committing gross

  military breaches as Commander of the Republican Guard, and of seizing

  and hiding military equipment and modern heavy weaponry in a family camp

  in Raimat Hum
