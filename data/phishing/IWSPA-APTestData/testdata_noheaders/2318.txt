Please note there is a 48-hour deadline for all travel requests.

  Even with the team model described in the attached security notice, RSO

  still requires this 48-hour lead time to conduct advance site surveys,

  route analysis, and to schedule and assign resources, particularly in

  light of the continuing civil disorder in Sanaâ€™a.

  Movement requests submitted with less than 48-hours advance will be

  denied; submitting mission critical requests (such as movement to or

  from the airport) may result in other missions being canceled that could

  have been supported with sufficient advance notification.

  If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact RSO.
