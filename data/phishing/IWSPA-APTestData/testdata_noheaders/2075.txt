Let me know if you have some time in your schedule while here in NY (our offices are at 53/7th).  Happy to grab a bite or go out for a drink.

Thanks for the time last week.  Rob is prepping some info that we would like to show over to you and maybe he and someone on your team can sit down together to evaluate some of our assumptions.
