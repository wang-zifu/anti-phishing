Program SLC.2951: *Phone Call Is REQUIRED              
Wage Garnishment Status: Pending...

Renee,

Happy New Year. I've been trying to reach you since last week regarding your student loans.
If we don't speak within the next 15-minutes, you're likely to have your wages garnished.
However, the SLC.295 program allows us to forgive your student loans, stopping any wage garnishment
Call me at (646) 902-9123. I'll get your student loan balance down to $0 within just 3-minutes.
Be clear, the state of CA will absolutely garnish your wages for up to 7-years over student debt
My User is Kelly House. Call me. I'll get you out of your student loan mess before they come after you.

P.S. They might also hold your 2015 tax return, so call me. It's your last chance.

Let's Talk
Kelly
