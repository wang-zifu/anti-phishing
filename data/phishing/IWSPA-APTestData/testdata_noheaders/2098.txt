Any interest?

User, August 13, 2015 

I attach a four page memo that my colleague and friend
Richard Lester have prepared about the outlook for nuclear
power in the U.S.

I did this because of your telling me that you were concerned
about this question and would welcome some outside view.

We shall be interested in your reaction.  And if you request it,
we will prepare a more complete paper.

Still at the cape.  We expect 19 guests in the next 21 days.
Mostly Phil and Marne collecting nice people.  Nevertheless
Pat and I may go to a motel.

I am set up to meet with Caroline Atkinson who, by all accounts,
is quite excellent.
