"Fwd: values of a soldier

Amy,

Congressman Steve Daines and House Republicans continue to refuse to renew unemployment insurance.

We’ve had 2,418 people join this critical fight, but until we get victory for all those families in need, we have to keep pushing. There’s still time to add your voice. Families everywhere are counting on you to act now.

Click here to call on the House to restore emergency unemployment insurance immediately. House obstructionists need to hear from all of us.

Thank you for joining this fight.
