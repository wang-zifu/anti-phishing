Hi, I hope you're all doing well.  I wanted to send this group a quick note=
 because I have accepted a new job and will be leaving USTR in several week=
s - so they will need a press secretary.

Because the TPP is a major priority for the Obama Administration in its fin=
al year, it's a uniquely demanding time for this agency and they want to ag=
gressively work to find a replacement who can start as quickly as possible.

If you know of smart, hard-working people who may be interested in the job,=
 or if you yourself are, please feel free to reach out to me.

And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about it.

All the best,

Andrew
