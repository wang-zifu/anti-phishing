"Just a quick hello--

Hi Michael,

Just thinking of you—I expect it has been a challenging year, and I hope you are keeping your spirits up as well as those of the team.  (Well, honestly, I don't doubt that you are.)

Best wishes for a restful Thanksgiving.  I can't believe how fast this year is flying by.  May 2015 allow our paths to cross again—we still have books and art to discuss!

Best,

Mark
