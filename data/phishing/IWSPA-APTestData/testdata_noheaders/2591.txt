Brian Deese is definitely in. Sounds like he told you he wanted to do it a while ago, but wasn't sure it registered. I'm also working on Amy Rosenbaum, as she's a pretty avid runner. Not sure if I'll get her there or not.

I actually looked at the course the other day for the first time. Didn't look nearly as bad as I thought it would be (will probably regret this statement)
