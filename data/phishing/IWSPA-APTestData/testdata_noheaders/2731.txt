Hello User!
I hope this note finds you well. I'm up at Martha's Vineyard for Obama vacation pool and am writing because I'm planing to write a profile of Vernon Jordan that is pegged to his 80th birthday but also his role in the civil rights movement in the context of some of the big 2015 themes, ie income inequality and #blacklivesmatter.

We know the Clintons are expected to attend his party this weekend but my story likely would run Thursday or Friday and I'm wondering where you would speak to me or my colleague Jen Epstein (cc'd) for this piece. Also whether HRC and/or WJC would give us comment for a profile of him and how to expedite those requests. 

Thank you for  your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Margaret
