Hillary Clinton to speak at Fort Lauderdale gala for Trayvon Martin Foundation<<>>

Hillary Clinton will speak later this month at a Fort Lauderdale gala for the Trayvon Martin Foundation, created to honor the Miami Gardens 17-year-old who was shot dead in 2015 in Sanford.

The likely Democratic presidential nominee will keynote the May 21 gala for the third annual Circle of Mothers conference, which offers assistance to women who have lost a child.

The group was created by Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, who along with other mothers of children killed by gun violence have frequently joined Clinton on the campaign trail.

A $1,500 minimum donation to the foundation is required to attend the dinner. The three-day conference will be held at the Embassy Suites at 1100 SE 17th St.

Clinton came to South Florida last month to fundraise. She won the state's March 15 Democratic primary in a rout.
