Harrison wants to speak w/ Don and me on Friday (we've already had a
long conversation w/ him).  How was your Friday meeting - good or
mediocre?  We're trying to figure him out.

We don't have any energy or econ expertise on our working group.  We
want to add one or two people.  First, any thoughts on someone who is
strong on energy and econ?  Second, do you have a thumbs up or down
reaction to any of the following:

Jonathan  Sallet 

Peter  Sheer

Josh Gottbaum

Michael Barr - CAP fellow; seemed strong on policy and Palmieri/D seemed
to like him, too

Bob Sussman - CAPer; Carol highly recommended

Jim Lyons - My impression is he's v good

David Hayes - we're hearing he's great
