"   As far as the group, Tusiad is one of the main secularist business groups.   They include sabanci, koc, (emre, also dogan? I forget)... Basically a lot   of the istanbul elite. I know the head of Tusiad in the US and see him   pretty regularly. We just had a long chat the other day. I can coordinate   with him from dc if needed. He knows everyone pretty much that has   anything to do with turkey and can facilitate a lot of contacts. Would   love to also work with marko on the euro scenarios.   This will be cool. Thanks for the opportunity, G.   Sent from my iPhone   On Dec 6, 2010, at 9:39 PM, Reva Bhalla <user@domain.com> wrote:     I'm glad you decided to do this.
