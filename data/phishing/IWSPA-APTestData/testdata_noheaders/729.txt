*On Milia:* Brynne explained that employees are paying 15-20% of the health
costs.  They're going to get her on a list for supporter housing until she
can find somewhere.  April 20th is great for a start date. Also, Brynne
pushed back on offering only $45k and reiterated $48k because of the shared
healthcare and moving costs, but she also said again that’s what they are
pushing because that’s how much Robby’s assistant makes. They don't do
relocation for junior staff, but would if they could.  How do you want to
handle this?  They’ll do what you want, of course.  I feel for Milia
because she’s breaking her lease early, has to do a new lease in NY, and
will have to take out a small loan to be able to handle the move.  Maybe
start at $45k with the option to review after 6 or 9 months?  Will relay to
Brynne whatever you decide.

*On Me:* Brynne hasn’t mentioned anything about submitting me to vetting,
so I’ll domain.com to bring that up until you get the green light on Neera about
the plan.
