Sir,

  Just spoke with Mr. Griffin and Mr. Venzke.  They tried to find you in the SANWEB system but couldn't...it's possible your account has been deleted.  They will coordinate with DISAM to either resurrect the old account or open a new one but need a few details from you, if you don't mind.  If you still have your user User, that would help them resurrect it; if not, no problem.  Also, they need to know the date of your last information awareness training (have to be within the one-year tolerance).
