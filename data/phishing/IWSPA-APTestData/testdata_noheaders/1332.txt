Friends,

We look forward to welcoming you to our first *HOUSE OF CODE *brunch
coinciding with White House Correspondent's weekend. Please view
this email as an official confirmation of your RSVP.

The event will be held at Kinship, *1015 7th St., NW *from 11:30am-1:30pm
on Saturday. Due to space and security concerns, only guests who appear on
the guest list will be admitted. This invitation
is strictly non-transferable and no exceptions can be made at this point.

"Smart casual" attire is requested, please.

And if you're running a bit behind schedule, don't worry - we have a
surprise for you. We've designed a *speakeasy** afterparty* where you'll be
able to hang out after the brunch formally ends.

We look forward to welcoming you tomorrow. Please reach out with any
questions.

Mark
