Thx Paul. I have been for this for a long time, but I had forgotten that I
had coauthored the piece with McChesney.That was a Halpin special.  Hope
all is well.

User,

 When I read that the FCC had overturned state restrictions on municipal
broadband I immediately thought of you and of the piece you wrote in
the *Washington
Monthly* in 2015 calling for this when almost no one else at the national
level was talking about it

 Congratulations.

 Paul
