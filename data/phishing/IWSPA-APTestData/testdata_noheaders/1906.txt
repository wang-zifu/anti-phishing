In further emails it is clear that they     are asking me to organize this conference including selecting speakers,     organizing tracks etc.  I see this as a chance to shape some thinking on     Turkey. It is time well spent.     I'd like the three of you to carry a lot of the load, as well as being     present at the conference of course.  I will be talking to them over the     next few days for more information, then I will want to get together     with you guys. I would like you to start thinking of potential speakers     both in Turkey and globally that should be at this conference.  I will     also need help developing scenarios, etc.  Obviously this increases",
