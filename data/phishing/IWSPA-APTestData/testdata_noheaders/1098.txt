"   Hi Todd,   How about ""Eurozone's Last Stand? Greek Panic and Germany's Choice""   Because I will be wrapping the discussion into a geopolitical assessment   of exactly what Germany's thinking is in all of this.   How does that sound?

I may not be able to get you a     formal advertisement tonight (sounds like folks got out of dodge quickly     after today's action) - will try and get something over to you first     thing in the morning.           Marko - As we advertise tomorrow's call, can you think of a good     descriptive title that would best frame your discussion points?  I want     to make sure we're not advertising something that you're not going to     address!           Thanks again!
