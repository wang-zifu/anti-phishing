      WOW -- I literally cannot believe this:

      This morning, Nancy Pelosi asked you to step up for Brad. When I 
went to check the numbers, I saw something AMAZING:

        1.. Your response was spectacular (ok, I expected that)
        2.. But as of 3pm, we=E2=80=99re within striking distance of $1 
MILLION(!!!) raised online for Brad. SERIOUSLY.

      $1,000,000.00 has A LOT of zeroes. And honestly, your support 
COULD NOT have come at better time.

      Why? This week alone, Boehner and billionaire Republicans are 
pounding the Chicago airwaves with over $2.5 million against Brad.

      So Gideon, we need your help right away.

      Chip in for Brad, answer Nancy's call-to-action, and help us reach 
$1 MILLION strong!

      If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, 
your donation will go through immediately:

            $5 >> $35 >>
            $50 >> $100 >>
            $250 >> Other >>

      GO GO GO!

      Tracy

      P.S. SO MANY ZEROES!!!
