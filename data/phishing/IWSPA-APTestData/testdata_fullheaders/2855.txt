Dear Amy,  Change LA—Liberty Hill’s party with a social-justice purpose—is happening next week on September 6. This afternoon mixer is one of the coolest fundraisers in town. What makes it so cool? For one thing, it’s where Alexandra Suh, Executive Director of Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA), will receive the Wally Marks Changemaker Award.  Alexandra was recently named one of the “People of 2014” by L.A. Weekly for KIWA’s high-profile campaign against illegal labor practices by L.A.’s most expensive restaurant, Urasawa. KIWA, which has been funded by Liberty Hill for many years, has been active through the years not only in workers' rights but also in anti-gentrification campaigns. When Alexandra became Executive Director in 2011, she refocused KIWA’s activities to return to its original mission as a workers center and to “really emphasize the fight for workers, building powerful workers.”  Now KIWA is a lead organization in the statewide coalition campaigning for passage of the Wage Theft Recovery Bill, which has recently passed the California Assembly with a vote set in the Senate any day now. KIWA is also an anchor organization for the Los Angeles Wage Theft Ordinance which seeks to strengthen the city’s ability to crack down on wage theft.  The Wally Marks Changemaker Award is given each year by Liberty Hill to an individual whose work in the community illustrates Dr. Martin Luther King’s insight that while “the arc of history is long, it bends toward justice.” It is named for a successful real estate developer who, as a Board member from 1989-2006 was particularly interested in emerging grassroots organizations and how they could reach higher levels of impact.  We’ll be honoring Alexandra September 6 from 3-5 pm. This casual mixer will be held at the Next Door Lounge in Hollywood, a modern speakeasy, and helps raise funds for Liberty Hill's critical work investing in grassroots community leaders at the frontlines of change.   Please read the lively Q & A with Alexandra that we’ve just posted to our blog: “Alexandra Suh: a Changemaker Personified” and then head over to our Change LA page to buy tickets or sponsorships for an afternoon of networking and social justice camaraderie that’s almost too cool for back-to-school season.   I will see you there!   Sincerely,   Shane Murphy GoldsmithPresident/CEO
