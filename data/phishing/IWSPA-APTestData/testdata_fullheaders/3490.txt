By shopping through Ziggedy this Christmas and beyond, the gifts that you are already going to buy and your everyday shopping could result in dozens of meals and care for hungry, homeless people, at no additional cost to you.

Click here to create an account on Ziggedy!

By creating an account through this email, one meal will be donated immediately, and you will automatically be sponsoring the Los Angeles Mission on Ziggedy!!
