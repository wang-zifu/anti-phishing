Subject: Need approval for The Nation Subscription

Will you please email Lindsey Reynolds for permission to get a new subscription to the Nation? We haven't renewed since 2015 so our account is deactivated, but regionals and researchers need access for their voting rights pieces. Subscriptions are $10 for 6 months.
