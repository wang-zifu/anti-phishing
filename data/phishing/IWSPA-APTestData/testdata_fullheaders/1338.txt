OrganizationChair Statement on Tonight's Primary Results

WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on tonight's Indiana primary results:

"Next stop, GOP convention chaos. Even a last-ditch VP pick from the desperate Cruz campaign this week couldn't derail Dangerous Donald, who picked up another batch of delegates tonight. Now that Trump is just a hair's-breadth away from the Republican nomination, it's official - this was the GOP's worst week yet.

"Trump proudly embraced endorsements from Bobby Knight, a chair-thrower with a history of misogyny, and Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist. Ted Cruz dodged questions about being called 'Lucifer in the flesh' by a former Republican Speaker of the House. And just this morning, Trump insinuated that Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of JFK. It's no wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it's been in more than two decades.

"Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our primary. I want to congratulate both of our candidates for continuing to run spirited, substantive campaigns worthy of the American people. Today it's clearer than ever, we must and we will elect a Democrat as our next commander in chief."
