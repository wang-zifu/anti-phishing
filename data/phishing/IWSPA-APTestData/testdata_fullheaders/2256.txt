From the AK Dem. Party, here are the options:

  *   For TV, I would suggest meeting with Steve MacDonald. He's well-respected, friendly to us, and the KTUU news broadcast is well-watched in and outside of Anchorage. Steve's contact information: (907) 762-9235 and user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>

  *   For Print, I suggest reaching out to Erica Martinson (user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>) or Devin Kelly (530-574-4230 and user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>) with the Anchorage Daily News. While based in Juneau, Becky Bohrer with the Associated Press ((907) 586-1515 and user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>) may be a good person to get in touch with as her stories get reprinted in other newspapers around the state. However, her stuff does not tend to get picked up by the Anchorage Daily News which is the state's largest paper.

  *   For Radio, I would recommend reaching out to Zachariah Hughes (based in Anchorage: (907) 550-8424 and user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>) or Liz Ruskin (based out of D.C.: (202) 488-1961 and user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>) with Alaska Public Radio.
