John -

When we were still in the quiet phase, Laurene Powell Jobs had invited HRC
to come meet with some of the ed reformers to hear their views.  Lona, Jake
and I had approved of the idea and tried to calendar it, but it has become
clear that it won't happen with HRC's calendar.

The folks involved are both $$ and substance folks.  Stacey Rubin from
Laurene's office suggested that in lieu of HRC that you and I do a
roundtable meeting with the group when you are out in the area.  I know the
Finance Team is putting a schedule together for you and I've raised this
meeting to their attention, but wanted to get it on your radar screen too.

The folks that Laurene would invite include:
Carrie Walton Penner
Reed Hastings
Stacey Childress
Brook Buyers
John and Ann Doerr

Please let me know if you agree that this would be a good meeting for the
two of us to do together and then the Finance folks can work with me to get
it scheduled.

Thanks!

-Ann
