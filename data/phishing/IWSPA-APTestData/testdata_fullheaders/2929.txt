Dear Mr user

I work on BBC News' award-winning radio history programme, Witness, in whic
h we talk to people who lived through, or witnessed, great events in histor
y.

We want to do an edition on the historic handshake between Yasser Arafat an
d Yitzhak Rabin, in September 1993, to be broadcast next week.

And we want to get a sense of what was going on behind the scenes that day 
- the last minute flurry of negotiations, the atmosphere, the worries about
 what might or might not go wrong; the scene which President Clinton recoun
ts in his memoirs of how he and his aides practised  what might happen if C
hairman Arafat moved to embrace Prime Minister Rabin, and how to ensure tha
t they did shake hands. Witness is a programme of personal memories and we 
would be delighted if you would be willing to share with us your memories o
f that day.

With best wishes

Louise
