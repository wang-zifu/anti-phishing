Team,

Tara and I spoke with Ari and Christina. They really are smart and
committed to the work.

They have a lot of questions that I can't answer. They want to join
the conversation rather than be subject to it. Seems fair. Because Ari
gets married on Sunday we have a window to have them all on the line
Thursday afternoon. Ari meets with his wedding Rabbi at 4:30 Eastern
but we're otherwise clear on our end. Can we try 3:00 PM Thursday?

There was also a feeling that we should open-source a lot of the
resources that we have--dump the research book and the video, etc.. on
the web. Something to discuss.

best,

-Tom
