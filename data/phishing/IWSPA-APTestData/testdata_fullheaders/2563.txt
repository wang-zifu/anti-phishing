John --

I wanted to take a minute to reinforce Barack's message.

We wouldn't be preparing to celebrate this historic inauguration if it 
weren't for you.  But the deadline to get your ticket to history is just a 
few hours away.

Time and again you have stepped up to support this movement in inspiring 
ways.  Now you can help give this administration a strong start.

Ten supporters and their guests will be selected to come to Washington, 
D.C., and attend the welcome ceremony, the swearing in, the Inaugural 
Parade, and the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball.

Make a donation of $5 or more before midnight tonight and you could be a 
part of the inaugural events:

You believed in Barack's message of change and helped build the grassroots 
movement that made history.

No matter where you are on Inauguration Day, we'll all come together and 
remember why we put so much work into making this happen.

Thank you for everything,

David

P.S. -- You can be part of this moment without making a donation. 
Participate by telling us in your own words what this inauguration means 
to you.  Learn more now:

John --

On January 20th, our journey to bring change will officially begin.

We're organizing the most open and accessible inauguration in our nation's 
history. And we're doing it without contributions from Washington 
lobbyists or big corporations.

Just like we did on the campaign, we're relying entirely on supporters 
like you -- ordinary people giving whatever they can afford to make this 
an event for all Americans.

I know we've asked a lot of you. But changing the way business is done in 
Washington will take a commitment from all of us. Right now, you can help 
give this administration a strong start.

And if you make a donation of any amount before midnight tonight, you 
could be selected to come to Washington, D.C., and be part of the welcome 
ceremony, the swearing in, the Inaugural Parade, and the Inaugural 
Community Ball.

Make a donation of $5 or more and be part of the historic moment you made 
possible:

We have a long road ahead of us, and we're going to face some major 
challenges as soon as we start. But I know I can count on you every step 
of the way.

Thank you for everything you've done and happy New Year,

Barack

P.S. -- You could be there for this historic moment even if you cannot 
make a donation.  You can show your support by sharing what this 
inauguration means to you.  Learn more here:
