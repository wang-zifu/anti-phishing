Hello All,
Unfortunately we weren't able to send a tracker to this event. But good
news: we were able to capture the event via online-streaming video. Below
are the notes from that effort.

Big Highlights*

   - Speaks to RNC-financed wardrobe: The clothes like the lighting and
   everything else isn't mine It doesn't belong to me. The RNC bought it. I
 am
   back to wearing my favorite consignment shop dress from anchorage Alaska
,
   Earing made my native Alaskan mother in law =96 goes through the rest of
 her
   accessories
   - Says America isn't the problem - it's the solution
   - Gets large amount of boos from audience when she says Obama has alread
y
   written his inaugural speech; says we don't assume your votes - we
   respectfully ask for hem
   - Hammers the Obama-Pelosi-Reid agenda mainly on taxes; claims it will
   erode American work ethic and pushes it as socialist (even un-American -
 "We
   don't believe America is the problem. We believe America is the solution
!")

Speech Highlights Let me address the clothes thing, glad Elizabeth gave me 
a
chance to talk about this. The clothes like the lighting and everything els
e
isn't mine It doesn't belong to me. The RNC bought it. I am back to wearing
my favorite consignment shop dress from anchorage Alaska, Earing made my
native Alaskan mother in law =96 goes through the rest of her accessories

Thanks soldiers for being there, and their service and sacrifice

Talks up Tampa Rays =96 who would have thought =96 you know something about
being an underdog into a victor

Florida are your eady to help us carry your state to victory? Are you ready
to make John McCain the next president of the United States? Are you ready
to send us to Washington to shake things up? This is about the future of
America

It was reported that Obama's inaugural speech is already written, 9 days
out. BO and I have spent some time on the basketball court. You have to win
the game before you cut down the net. Its like the seal, germany and the
stadium they have already rented, its like they think the whole election
thing is a matter formality

We need John McCain, someone who will fight for you

With our economic plan, we will help Americans keep their home by cleaning
up the corruption in Washington, we will help all of us to afford healthcar
e
and help our students afford college.

Small business are the backbone of the American economy

We are going to let you keep more of your money, we will cut taxes and
business taxes to help keep American business in America

We already know with National security the difference with the tickets and
how you will have a winning hand with our ticket

We need to hear the difference on the economy, our opponent is not being
honest with his plan, it is not negative campaigning to question plans and
proposals

He says he is now for a tax domain.com =96 that is where the government takes y
our
money and distributed it based on the their priorities

Thanks to Joe the Plumber =96 he got our opponent to say what his real plan
 is
=96to take your money and dolling it out how he wants =96 Joe the plumber c
alled
it socialism and it is not the time to experiment with that

Talks about Tito the builder =96 he isn't pleased with how the Obama camp h
as
been roughing up Joe the plumber. Tito wants to know, why the heck are you
going after Joe the Plumber? Tito is an immigrant from Colombia =96 everyth
ing
is possible in America. Tito said I was born in Colombia but I was made in
the USA. Tito is not the only supporter that feels that way. Doesn't seem
like many of you will be supporting Barack the wealth spreader

Out opponents is for bigger government =96and that is not the solution. We 
are
going to spread opportunity around =96so you can create new wealth. We have
 a
fundamental difference in our views

He voted 94 times for higher taxes =96 he had the opportunity to be on your
side and he voted 94 times to be on big governments side. Do the math or go
with your gut either way Barack Obama will raise your taxes

We think bureaucracy should do more with less =96 so Florida lets fight for
what is right, lets elect John McCain to be your next president. Simply Joh
n
and I do not think you should be working for government, we think it should
work for you. We need to get it back on your side.

We have a 10 trillion dollar debt, we need to stop digging the hole we are
in. We will put a sending freeze on everything but the most vital of
programs.  We have not been talking the talk we have been walking the walk,
John McCain as a Sen has been taking on corruption and abuses and has the
scares to prove it. Now I will tell you of some of my accomplishments as
Gov. Up their in AK I eliminated property taxes, reducing and eliminating
other taxes and fees, as Governor also I had to take on the good ol boys in
my own party used the veto pen on wasteful spending, you come out of that
with scars too but it is the right thing to do. We are returning the surplu
s
to the people of AK because it is their money. We got back to basics =96 we
will use the same common sense conservatism to make the government work for
you.

Florida will you hire us? Will you send us back to Washington? You Betcha!
We can not domain.com to work for you. We will put us back on a path to energy
independence.

[CHANT: Drill baby Drill]

Some of our energy dollars is ending up in volatile countries that use
energy as a weapon. We need to spend that money here in America creating
jobs.

We will develop the technologies needed =96 clean coal and we will drill he
re
and drill now

We need American energy resources brought to you by American ingenuity.

Talks about helping Families with Special needs =96 too often children with
special needs have been set apart and excluded =96 that attitude is such a
disservice to those kids to their family and to this country I will work to
change that. John and I have a vision of America where every innocent life
counts. Where everyone has a chance to contribute, and that is the domain.com I
want to bring to Washington DC

As Vice President I want to do more, let these kids and families know they
come first and that they have a friend in the White House.

As the election draws near you are getting a clearer vision of your choice.
A politician who puts his trust in government or a leader who puts his trus
t
in you. It's the difference between spreading wealth and opportunity.

Remember we are at war and we need someone who isn't afraid to use the word
victory when talking about those wars. J Mac won't cut troop funding. Thank
God J Mac knows how to win a war and as a mother I know we need him as POTU
S

We believe the best of America is not gathered in DC. We believe it's here
in the hard-working Americans who toil and die for us. We believe America i
s
not the problem. America is the solution
