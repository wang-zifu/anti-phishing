Katrina Pierson:

-          On Muslim Ban: "Everything a candidate says is just a suggestion"

-          Republicans have campaigned on issues, then capitulated. Trump will work to get his policies passed

-          On "John Miller" interview: "It doesn't sound like Mr. Trump to me. It sounds like definitely a New Yorker, but it doesn't sound like Mr. Trump. If he says it wasn't him, then it wasn't him."
