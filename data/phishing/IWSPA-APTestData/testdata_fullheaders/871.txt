Executive Highlights - Talent Development: A Boardroom Imperative

Dear Amy:

When it comes to talent development, studies suggest higher success rates are achieved with internal candidates. Additionally, outside candidates cost, on average, about 65 percent more than internal candidates, yet they tend to be removed from the job early on--about seven times more than internal candidates. 

These are just a couple of compelling facts from NACD's latest Blue Ribbon Commission report, Talent Development: A Boardroom Imperative, which outlines the reasons boards need to make talent development a primary focus. View complimentary highlights from this report. For a full copy of the report, click here.

I invite you to join NACD and receive regular access to insights like these, as well as the resources, tools, knowledge exchange forums, and prestigious network of 14,000 board members to help you lead with the highest standards of excellence. 

Through Dec. 31, 2013, the annual investment in an NACD Full Board Membership is $3,900 for up to six directors. Executives are invited to join under the Full Board Membership category. NACD Individual Director Membership is also available for $675 per year. 

To join, or for more information on how NACD can help your board become more effective and efficient, please contact me at
