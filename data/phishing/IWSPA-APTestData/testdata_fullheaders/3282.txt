                         Dear readers,



If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.

	Leica Digilux 1: Legendary charm  
	The legendary German lens maker takes aim at digital-era
  street photographers with the Digilux 1. A combination of
  speed, manual control, and advanced features helps this
  4-megapixel camera provide a digital option to shutterbugs
  with an eye for the decisive moment.

	Onkyo LS-V950: The complete package



	This home-theater kit boasts a long list of enviable
  features, including progressive-scan video output and as many
  inputs and outputs as most budget A/V receivers. And it
  sounds nice, too.

	Panasonic DMC-F7: The littlest Lumix
	The baby of Panasonic's new Lumix digital camera line, this
  ultracompact 2-megapixel model offers Leica optics, a svelte
  design, and a solid, basic feature set. But how does it fare
  when it comes to performance and image quality? We slipped it
  in our shirt pocket and went out for a shoot to find out.

	Toshiba Pocket PC e740: 400MHz in your hand 
	Powered by Intel's new 400MHz XScale processor and boasting
  integrated Wi-Fi connectivity, Toshiba's new PDA is an
  impressive mobile machine. We got hands on with it to test
  the new chips and its myriad features. See how it did.

	Samsung DVD-P721M: Sticking out in a crowd
	Samsung's affordable DVD-P721M not only offers
  progressive-scan playback but also has a built-in Memory
  Stick slot. Is this the ideal DVD deck for owners of Sony
  digital cameras, camcorders, and MP3 players? Read the review
  to find out more.

	Unitech 2U4U DMR-300: A sweet MP3 player 
	This new flash-based MP3 player blew us away right out of the
  box, with its slick styling, 128MB of expandable memory,
  in-line remote control, and low price. The fact that it can
  encode WMA files in real time from any line-level
  audio source is the icing on an already very tasty cake.

	Siemens S46: A business-focused phone
	The company's second mobile for the U.S. market picks up
  where the stylish S40 left off. Like that earlier model, this
  one is a world phone with business-centric features. How
  impressive is it?

	Archos Jukebox Recorder 20: Old look, new connectivity 
	A must-have feature for any large-capacity MP3
  player/recorder is a high-speed connection that allows for
  quick transfer of hundreds--or even thousands--of files.
  Archos's next-generation product, the 20GB Recorder 20, has a
  USB 2.0 connection, but how does it stack up against the
  competition otherwise? Read the review.

	Philips DVD953AT: Budget progressive-scan model
	This moderately priced deck faces stiff competition from
  Toshiba, Panasonic, and Zenith budget models. How does it
  fare? Read the review to find out.

            The last Palm OS 4 PDA



	Check back later this week for our review of the Sony CLIE
  PEG-T665C. This Palm OS 4.1 PDA has a built-in audio player
  so that you can listen to MP3s on the go as well as a 66MHz processor for
  better video playback. But with OS 5 expected before
  Christmas, is now the time to buy a high-end Palm?
