What's new in this week's edition        

         This Week On THR iPad   * THE MORNING AFTER TWILIGHT: Robert Pattinson was at the apex of his career. His response? He sold his $6 million house ("too big") and sidled up to A-list directors, two of whose movies he starred in at Cannes: "I don’t need anything. I don’t want anything at all."

* SILICON BEACH POWER 25: Hollywood is transforming into a two-industry town fast as tech migrates south from the Valley (as in Silicon) to the Beach. The Hollywood Reporter breaks down the top players.

* UCSB SHOOTER'S THERAPIST: Dr. Charles Sophy frequently dispenses advice on "Celebrity Rehab," has reportedly treated Paris Hilton and wanted suspect Elliot Rodger to take an anti-psychotic, but he never did.

iPAD EXTRA: Video of Sandra Oh, Alyson Hannigan and 28 other supporting actor Emmy contenders gathering for THR's once-in-a-lifetime photo.
