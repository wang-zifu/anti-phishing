--Report on HRC giving first national interview. Hannity shows clip of HRC
saying that when you are subjected to the kind of constant barrage of
attacks that are largely coming from the right people will question
trustworthiness. In a clip shown she mentions this theme being used against
the Clintons for years and that the American voter will weigh the evidence.
Says that people should and do trust her. Carly Fiorina joins the show to
comment on HRC=E2=80=99s interview. Hannity quotes Carl Bernstein saying HR
C has,
=E2=80=9Ca difficult relationship with the truth,=E2=80=9D and Fiorina resp
onds that HRC
did not accept accountability or answer any questions during the interview.
 She
says that HRC has lived in her own bubble for too long and just wants
people to trust her. Hannity says that items were subpoenaed and HRC waited
years to turn them over. Fiorina responds that the polls indicate that
people don=E2=80=99t trust her. Mentions that HRC was not asked about her r
ecord as
secretary of state including the reset button with Putin and calling Assad
a positive reformer. Hannity says HRC dismisses the idea of the Clinton
Foundation taking money from countries with horrible human rights records.
Fiorina says HRC wants to run as the first woman candidate but she took
human rights and women=E2=80=99s rights off the table as secretary of state

--Commentary on HRC giving her first national interview. Megyn Kelly says
fact checkers issued their report on statements HRC made including her
saying she has never gotten a subpoena. Congressman Gowdy who sent her one
says otherwise. Shows clip of HRC saying she never received a subpoena in
the interview. Next shows clip of Rep. Gowdy saying HRC had a failure of
memory and that she received on in March. Katy Pavlich joins to comment and
says that HRC was subpoenaed on March 4, 2015 and notes that her lawyer
acknowledged that the subpoena was received. Pavlich says that HRC=E2=80=99
s
understanding of the question was that she was not under subpoena at the
time that she was deleting emails. Megyn Kelly then points to HRC saying
that everything she did was under regulation. Pavlich says that in 2015 the
law changed saying that she is required to turn over all government emails
which HRC says she has done but Pavlich says there is no way to prove that.
Megyn Kelly says that in 2011, HRC told state dept. employees not to use
personal emails. Kelly then points to HRC said she went above and beyond
turning over emails. Pavlich says that HRC is trying to make the case to
American people that HRC was doing everyone a favor as if it wasn=E2=80=99t
 a
requirement. Kelly points to Jason Baron=E2=80=99s statement that HRC was r
equired
to turn over all State-business related emails and that she did not go
above and beyond. Kelly finally points to the fact that all official
business was already in the State Department server. Pavlich says that a
lot of HRC=E2=80=99s top aids were also using personal email accounts. The

--Commentary on HRC giving her first national interview. Lisa Kennedy shows
clip of HRC saying people should and do trust her and that she cannot
decided what the attacks will be, no matter how unfounded. Kennedy says
that HRC never says anything of substance and that she uses polling data
instead of real evidence. Panelist says HRC is going to ride the victim
train to the White House, citing examples of Benghazi and Monica Lewinski,
which panelist calls, =E2=80=9Ca vast right wing conspiracy.=E2=80=9D Kenne
dy says this was
the only strategy that works for HRC. Panelist says they cut out the part
of the interview where HRC said she was going to be attacked, most likely
by a Hispanic male. Kennedy says that she can=E2=80=99t believe that was sa
id on
national TV and that HRC is her own worst enemy. HRC says illogical things,
according to Kennedy, but somehow people still vote for her. Kennedy on Fox

--Bill O=E2=80=99Reilly talks about immigration issues. Says that HRC wants
 a
policy where people are reportedly deported. Shows a clip of HRC saying San
Francisco was a case where we have deported many times and the city made a
mistake not to deport someone who the federal government strongly felt
should be deported. O=E2=80=99Reilly says that HRC made a mistake and no ci
ty can
deport anyone, that is the job of the federal government and the Democratic
Party has been very soft on border security and holding sanctuary cities
accountable. Says that they will not change because they want Latino votes.
