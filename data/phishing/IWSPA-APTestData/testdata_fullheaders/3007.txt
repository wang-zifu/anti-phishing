Sadly for tonight we don't have time hours of back and forth on our end tha
t leads to nothing. We did that last week and had to pull out of 6 pitched 
interviews. To avoid burning everyone again, we need her avail window befor
e we pitch. Since we don't have that for tonight, I'll book other spoxes av
ailable for tonight's segments.

For tomorrow, need to confirm her avail from 4 to 5pm asap to lock-in CNN (
Tapper) and MSNBC (Kate Snow).

For next Tues & Weds, lets get her avails so we know what we're pitching.

Thanks!
