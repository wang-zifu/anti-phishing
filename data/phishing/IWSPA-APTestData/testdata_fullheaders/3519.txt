OrganizationChair Statement on Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day

"Today we honor and remember the stories of the six million Jews and millions of others who perished in the Holocaust. We also celebrate the lives of those who survived, and the heroes who courageously fought the forces of ignorance, hatred, bigotry and brutality to end the Nazi regime and forge a brighter future for mankind.

"Although the final days of the Holocaust are in our past, we must forever carry its lessons in our hearts and remain ever-vigilant not to repeat the same mistakes. Just last week, in my home state, the FBI thwarted a plot by a man who was trying to bomb the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center. So our work is never finished, and we must work together to confront this kind of hatred and call out those who would incite others to violence wherever and whenever they do.
"The lessons of the Holocaust are especially important to remember during election season, when the rhetoric of national politics will no doubt get heated. On this Yom Hashoah, the Democratic Party remains committed to the American values of inclusion and diversity, and we reject fear-mongering or the denigration of any group of people because of their faith, race or gender. Let us pledge today to continue to work to stop bigotry and hatred, knowing that our nation will be stronger for it."
