Get Ready!




		My dear fellow investor when is the last time you actually made a
		few bucks in the market?



		With this bull pattern going on it is hard to find a winner that will
		stand out and actually produce gains that are above average.



		Not only do I believe that I've found a solid company but I am certain
		that I've found the next company that will quintuple in a heart beat.



		RCHA is set to take the world by storm and this little pharmaceutical
		company should soar from current levels of 20 cents to over a dollar
		this coming week.



		If you don't believe me just watch where it goes on Monday and I promise
		you, you will want to buy as much as you can to make sure you catch this
		rocket before it takes off. I expect to see it nearly double on Monday
		alone. God knows how high and how fast
		RCHA will go from there on.
