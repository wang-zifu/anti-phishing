Finally a home game

ASM2 came to America in a big way last night with 8.7mil in Thurs evening shows ( which started at 7pm ) and include some great IMAX results .

Its up there with the big boys-

Â Captain America got in 10.2mil during Spring Break earlier this year as part of a 37mil opening day and 95mil FSS . It played strongly young male which helped the late shows . It also had a -6% Sat from Fri which we hope to beat with our appeal to families . 

Thor had 7.1mil in Thurs evening ( 8pm )shows and an 85.7mil FSS . We'd love to stay ahead of that pace off our better start . 

ASM#1 as well as coincidentally SM3 had 7.5mil on the old midnight show model .

The biggest full day gross in the market yesterday was Other Woman at 1.85mil 

We're off to a great start to what should be a great day and a great weekend worldwide .
