Dear Google AdWords Customer,
During our regular database verification process, we were

  unable to verify your account information. This might be

  due to one or more of the following reasons:
1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)
2. Submitting invalid information during initial enrollment process.
3. Inability to accurately verify you account information due to an

  internal error within or database management system.

We would require login in to your Google AdWords so that we can verify

  that you are the rightful owner of the account. All you nedd to do is

  go to Google AdWords and enter your username and password:
<>

Thank you for using Google AdWords,

  We appreciate your business and the opportunity to serve you.

  Google AdWords Service
