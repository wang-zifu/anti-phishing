When I talked to her about it we had originally talked about it as two separate meetings. It's a good opportunity to ask about their thinking on the voting rights town hall, discuss timing, for example. And we're not getting much booked on MSNBC so she needs to recognize that we have a problem and need her to help ease tensions. Part of what we need to make sure is that the New Hampshire debate is in the past. We can't keep fighting about it, so how do we improve the relationship from here on out.

The chair is happy to meet with Phil tomorrow. She wanted to note the point of Griffin's presence is, of course, to be there when she meets with Mika.
