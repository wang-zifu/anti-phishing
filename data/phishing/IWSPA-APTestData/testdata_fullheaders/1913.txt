From MaryPat Bonner, re: situation with Progressive Media USA (PM)  and Fund
for America (FFA):

- PM may have shut down even without Obama campaign's comments, but it was
like the straw that broke the camel's back.

- It became apparent that raising money for a media group would be swimming
upstream, given the Obama campaign's position that they did not want their
funders funding messaging 527s.

- It wasn't a "wink and nod" type of situation; they really did not want
this kind of activity. David Brock had reached out to 15 Obama people who
Daschle and Brian Mathis had suggested for the board, and they all said no,
because the campaign had told them not to. Same thing kept happening when
people were asked to co-host FFA events -- they asked the campaign and the
campaign said no.

- People leading PM and FFA aren't really that into Obama. They are willing
to do this to ensure Dem victory, but are not passionate about the candidate
himself. They could have lived with a public response of "don't do it," but
when people are even being told privately not to fund it, they don't see how
they can possibly raise the amount of money they want to raise. Nobody is
going to kill themselves to raise this money just to be attacked by the
person you are trying to help.

- It's unreasonable to think you could raise all of this money from a bunch
of Clinton people who don't like Barack that much, especially after this
long fought primary.

- Not sure what PM closing will do to FFA. Anna Burger has gone to the
campaign, and has been told, we meant no "527 swiftboating," and that we
don't mean you can't fund community organizations, ACORN, NARAL, etc. But
that may not be enough.

- FFA needs the campaign to make a public statement clarifying their
position about these groups, and stop telling their funders not to give to
them. They also need to "throw FFA a bone" by giving them someone from the
Obama camp, such as Gephardt or Daschle, to go on the road and help raise
money. If they don't, FFA may shut down within a month.

- People have other things to do, and not going to kill themselves raising
money for someone who is not going to be thankful or supportive; and
reluctant to go against him for fear of backlash or becoming "persona non
grata" if he becomes President.

- Right now the Obama camp is raising money in $2,300 increments, and for
the Organizationin $28,000 increments. They don't have a place to take big checks.
But there are 46 people who have double-maxed out to Obama who are
billionaires, and they should all be solicited.

- A lot of the Obama donors are new and green; they don't understand the
value of 527s, and are not used to funding them. It's an uphill battle to
educate them, especially when they just go right back to the campaign.
