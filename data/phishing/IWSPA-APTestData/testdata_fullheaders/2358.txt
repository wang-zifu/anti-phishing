John-

=C2=A0

I don=E2=80=99t know if you=E2=80=99ve heard, but it was announced rece
ntly that 2,100 Hoosier jobs were being shipped to Mexico in a huge los
s for our working families in Indiana=2E =C2=A0

=C2=A0

This shows that we need a leader in Washington who understands that fig
hting to keep good-paying jobs in Indiana is a top priority=2E =C2=A0As
 congresswoman, I will work to protect the jobs we already have, suppor
t the creation and relocation of jobs to Indiana, and invest in better 
education for our youth and adults so that we can actually fill those j
obs with hard working Hoosiers=2E

=C2=A0

This is an important issue to me and to the people of the 9th district=2E

=C2=A0

=C2=A0

Will you chip in to help me get to Washington and start working for you
 to attract better jobs to Indiana?

=C2=A0

We have our monthly fundraising deadline coming up next week, and we ne
ed more help than ever to get our message on jobs out=2E =C2=A0We are s
till $5000 short of our goal for the month and we can=E2=80=99t do this
 without you! Please consider helping me out with a contribution today!

=C2=A0

Help protect Hoosier jobs today! Chip in what you can!

=C2=A0

With gratitude,

Shelli
