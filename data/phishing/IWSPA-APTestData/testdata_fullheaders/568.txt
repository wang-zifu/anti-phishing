John,

The FBI has indicated that they are inclined to decline interim security
clearance for Benjamin Rhodes who is OFA senior speechwriter and national
security policy person. They have not shared an explanation as to why. If
his interim status is denied, the FBI will still undertake a full-clearance
process review of his application post-election and make a final
determination.

Susan and Sarah Sewall have expressed an interest in keeping Benjamin
involved in the process, but I have not followed up with them since
receiving this information today.

In terms of our options, we could ask the FBI for an explanation on the
denial and make a determination if it is worth pushing to obtain an interim
status, or we can domain.com for the full review post-election.

Let me know your thoughts on this.

Best,
Cassandra
