Dear Amy,

"Thanksgivukah" - it's on everybody's lips this week. The American day of gratitude and the Jewish festival of lights carry so much symbolism: Family and friends; stuffing and latkes; dreidels and football; gelt and pumpkin pie... Why not celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime holiday by giving the youngest victims of domestic abuse a reason to feel grateful this holiday season?

The National Library Initiative transforms rooms in domestic violence shelters into children’s libraries – creating both brand-new educational resources and safe havens for kids escaping violent homes. We all know that a library is only as good as its books, so won’t you help us fill the shelves? Help us reach our goal of 2,500 books by the new year! 

For every $7.00 you donate to JWI during the winter holidays, we will send a children’s book to a child in one of the 43 domestic abuse shelters with established JWI libraries.

Please join us in giving thanks by supporting our book drive, and sit down to your turkey and latkes, surrounded by family, knowing that your gift has brought hope and smiles to c
