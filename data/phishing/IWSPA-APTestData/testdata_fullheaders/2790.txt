RE: A favor

Hi Michael,

Just cleaning out my emails and thought I would say 'hi' and I was wondering what is happening with the letters you were going to have translated.

 A close friend, rod Garcia , is looking for film locations in Utah that look like Israel. Ideally they would not be national park land. Can he call or write you to get suggestions as to where to look?  Hope all is well. A big hug to the whole family. Michael
