Hi John (and Eryn),
I have our tickets for the dinner Saturday. I think easiest thing is to mee
t at the WSJ reception and I can give you your ticket then. It's in the Kal
orama Room on the lobby level. Print the attached invitation out so you can
 get past security.
FYI, our dinner table includes Joel Benenson, David Plouffe, Ben Rhodes-plu
s, for partisan balance, I guess, GOP talking head/former consultant Ana Na
varro. Also from the Journal there will be Jerry Seib and Beth Reinhard, wh
o covers Jeb Bush and the Republican side.
My cell is 202-446-4530 if you have any trouble, which I somehow doubt. Wha
t's your cell?
All best,
Laura

p.s. Eryn- are these still the best email addresses for both of you?
