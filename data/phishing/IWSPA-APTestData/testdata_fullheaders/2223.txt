I missed the beginning of the Trump interview but came in when he was argui
ng that his tax plan will be negotiated and not look like what he put out. 
He claimed it would be a boon for the middle class and raise his taxes. We 
could/maybe should do a hit on  this. Sounded like he didn=92t know his own
 plan.

On a Fox panel one of the commentators (Kim something?) hit Trump for chang
ing his mind on his tax plan this week.

He was asked about his flip flop on the minimum wage and he said he was ope
n to changing it but he really wanted to bring jobs where people could earn
 more.

He was asked how he could keep Carrier and other companies here when the pr
oducts for the Trump Collection aren=92t made in the US. He said that the i
tems for his collection aren=92t made here and didn=92t think it was hypocr
itical=85.

There is probably more from this interview so someone should take a second 
look.
