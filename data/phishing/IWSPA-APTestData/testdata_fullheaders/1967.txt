Pretty amazing!  Well done.  Steve. Sent on the run On Oct 29, 2014, at 5:55 PM, Kevin O'Leary <user@domain.com> wrote:Mark/SteveShark Tank has been on the air long enough that an outcome like this was inevitable. Eventually a fast growing Shark Tank Company would be acquired by a strategic competitor. That is exactly what happened tonight to Groove Book. Shutterfly a public company has purchased Groovebook for $14,500,000 cash. This is a huge proof of the Shark Tank platform beyond its reality TV fame. Shark tank is now a proven venture capital platform that creates value for shareholders and makes millionaires out of its entrepreneurs.Groovebook used the Shark Tank viewership to grow its subscription base from 15,000 when they first aired two seasons ago to over 380,000 currently. Shutterfly decided to take it out while they could afford it. My team at O'Leary Ventures helped negotiate and structure the deal for Julie and Brian Whiteman. The original offer by Shuuerfly was $7,000,000 so I feel we have really added value. As a measure of IRR this is my best Shark Tank deal ever.This outcome is hard news, this should run on GMA's first hour and on ABC World News. I will be working with Patrick Preblick at ABC in NY, Caroline Mendoza at Sony in NY and Marsha Smith with ABC in LA and with the PR people at Shutterfly to get the story out. This is a classic rags to riches story and Shark Tank is the platform that deserves much of the domain.com.Shutterfly now owns 100% of Groovebook and because they are public they must first report their earnings before they can announce this deal. We must coordinate the release with Sutterfly to keep them onside with the SEC  but I think ABC news should be ahead of the curve and be reporting it ASAP so that we can support the Shark Tank platform at the same time.Also the deal was a multi-month negotiation so it will provide excellent content for the new "Outside the Shark Tank Show.P.S. Needless to say don't trade in Shutterfly stock until this transaction is disclosed.KO
