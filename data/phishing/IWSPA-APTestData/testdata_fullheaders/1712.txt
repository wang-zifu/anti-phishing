Trump with Piers Morgan

Iraq War investigation?
- Blair shouldn't have gone into Iraq
- Shouldn't be tried for war crimes
- To the victor go the spoils, but we didn't even take the oil

Blair and Bush?
- Leaders shouldn't be concerned about their relationship
- Do what's right for the country

Straight talking?
- Political correctness is killing our country

How rich are you?
- I put in my financials. Tremendous company.
-$10 billion
- Could easily finance a campaign

Lord Sugar says he is richer than you?
- No. He's a small-timer.
- He works for me (on version of the Apprentice)
- When first hired, he was so low on economic scale that he didn't fit the role

What do you mean when you say "the look?"
- The look is important
- Age happens and other things
- Want to stay looking sharp

Stories about you and princess Diana?
- Stories are so false
- But did meet her once
- Liked and respected her
