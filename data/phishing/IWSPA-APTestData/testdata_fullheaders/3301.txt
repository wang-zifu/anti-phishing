I couldn't meet Wally in person today because of travel issues related to th
e "snow" but we talked by phone. He's very interested and wants to talk deta
ils.  We're having breakfast Friday am to go through the role, the structure
, and the timing and then if all goes well I'll set him up to talk to HRC ne
xt week.
