Subject: Convention

Hey Mark, Hope all's well.

Have you heard anything more through the grapevine about Sanders plans at the convention?

He hasn't really looked so hot recently with the Nevada thing. I wonder if you guys have been talking to him or prepping at all for upheaval.

Happy to go off-record or come back to you when I have more, but I'm interested in whether you are taking it for granted at this point that he will try to disrupt the convention or bring motions to the floor...

Thanks--
