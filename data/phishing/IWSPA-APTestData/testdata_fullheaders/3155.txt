Hello Amy,

Are you sure your existing backup will keep your data safe?

Don't get us wrong, but there are plenty of other variables in play: your data recovery plan may be wasted if nobody on your team knows how to implement it, or if it takes too long to deploy after your server goes down. And what do you do about damaged hardware?

In short, your data protection protocol may still have plenty of chinks in the armor.

With a partner like All Covered by your side, you can implement an affordable, complete backup solution that virtually eliminates uncertainty in your backup strategy.

All Covered Backup for Servers is a simple-to-deploy but comprehensive solution that combines local and cloud backup, with continuity features that reduce business interruptions to a minimum.

With All Covered Backup for Servers, you can backup your servers to a secure Data Center, and then if needed, restore anything from an email or document to an entire server. After completing your setup, All Covered will continue to support your plan, by monitoring and fine-tuning the backup as your requirements evolve.

All Covered Backup for Servers can serve as the cornerstone of a recovery plan that keeps your business running, even under the most challenging of circumstances.
