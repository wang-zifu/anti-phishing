Spoke to Zac and told him about our messages of the week, infrastructure (Mon, Tues, Weds) and guns (Thurs, Fri).

He is more focused on getting state parties and Members of Congress to hit Trump on his tax returns - statements, events, etc.

Zac is less interested in a policy issue like roads and bridges, where Trump is actually pretty good (Trump has said our airports look like crap compared to Dubai, for example).

I told him we could focus on infrastructure and guns in the states and continue to go after tax returns with national press. He wasn't completely sold. Told him I'd huddle with our team and circle back with him.

Thoughts?
