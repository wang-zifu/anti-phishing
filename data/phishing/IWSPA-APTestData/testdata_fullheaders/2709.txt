John --

Yep, me again. Surprise: I'm here to ask you for money.

Here's why: Tomorrow is our biggest fundraising deadline
yet, and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask everyone
who is able to make a donation.

We just can't win without supporters like you pitching in what
you can, when you can -- we're facing too much special-interest
spending on the other side to keep up without everyone doing
their part.

Can you donate $3 or more before tomorrow night's deadline?

To be frank, we've gotten our behinds handed to us the past two
FEC deadlines by Mitt Romney and his crew. I'll refrain from sharing
how that really makes me feel.

But that hasn't stopped us from opening more offices, hiring more
field organizers, and reaching out to more voters. Ultimately, that's
what's going to deliver us a win in November -- and that's all thanks
to the 2.4 million grassroots donors like you who are building this
campaign.

It might sound crass, but ramping up our ground game to the level
it needs to be across the country takes cash -- a whole lot of it.

You know what to do. Chip in if you can, before tomorrow at midnight:

99 days left. Here we go.
