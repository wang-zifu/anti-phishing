Hi David,




               Its been a while since my lunch with Michael on the lot, I've been busy launching below - perhaps you could share the news with him and ask if he's like to touch base on a call 310 488 7556 to reach me.




Watch the trailer here:

We did it, "Scorpion" the TV show about my life and company (<<link>>) is the highest rated new pilot on CBS.
I'm so proud of the team for making it this far, a huge thanks to all involved.
It will debut this fall during the Monday 9pm slot on CBS.

Thanks

Walter (<<link>>)
