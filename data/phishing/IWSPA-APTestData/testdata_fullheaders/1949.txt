a surprise for my mom

Friend-

My name is Katy and I am Janice Hahn's daughter. Over the years I have watched my mom work tirelessly to serve the people in her community. I am so proud of her and all the work she does in Congress to help the residents of Southern California.

Wish my mom a happy birthday!    

Her birthday is tomorrow and I'm thrilled that I get to spend it with her. One of the gifts I'd like to give her is to surprise her with well wishes from you. Please take a moment to click on this link to sign her birthday card. And while you're there, would you consider giving a donation to give her a really big birthday surprise?

I see how hard she works to stand up for what's right, and I want to show
