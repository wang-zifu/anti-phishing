Webinar: ISO 22301 – Will Your Communications Plan Meet The New 2015 Standard?




Hello Amy,
Emergencies or incidents can happen at a moment’s notice. During these events, it is important that the right people are informed with timely information. Because of this, you must consider how you will communicate with staff, responders and residents during an event.
Join this afternoon's webinar, where Ray Unrau, Director of Emergency Planning for Saskatoon, discusses how his city utilizes a critical communication plan to quickly deliver vital and relevant information, when it is needed.  Additionally, Ray will cover:

 Why his team needed a system for targeted mass notification  
Recent severe weather-related events and other incidents in Saskatoon that required use of the system  
Lessons learned for improving the activation of response teams and making situational awareness more effective 
And more best practices for critical communications and emergency notification



At the end of the webinar there will be a Q&A session with questions submitted prior to the webinar. 



Join the Webinar!
