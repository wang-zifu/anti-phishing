Feinstein on Clinton: =E2=80=98I could see her across the table from Putin
=E2=80=99

BY CURTIS TATE

*user@domain.com <user@domain.com>*

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton was =E2=80=9Cpresidential=E2=80=9D in her testimony
<<<link>>
42.html>
in
a House of Representatives hearing this week and would have no trouble
facing leaders such as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.

Feinstein said Clinton=E2=80=99s performance in theHouse Select Committee o
n
Benghazi
<<<link>>
07.html>
Thursday
left no doubt about her ability to do the job she=E2=80=99s seeking.

=E2=80=9CI think she showed a drive and a staying power and a motivation,
=E2=80=9D
Feinstein said in a conference call with reporters Friday. =E2=80=9CI could
 see her
across the table from Putin.=E2=80=9D

Feinstein, as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, held more than
a dozen hearings
<<<link>>

into
the 2015 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and
found nothing to implicate Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time.
The findings were unanimously endorsed by the Democrats and Republicans on
the Senate committee.

Feinstein and other Senate Democrats said the House hearing revealed
nothing new and it was time for Republicans to pull the plug. The panel is
the eighth government inquiry into the attack, in which four Americans were
killed, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

While the various probes have cleared Clinton, they have raised questions
about whether U.S. diplomatic facilities around the globe are adequately
protected.

One of the recommendations of Feinstein=E2=80=99s Senate investigation was
improving security at those compounds.

=E2=80=9CI think the best thing we could do is end these hearings,=E2=80=9D
 she said, =E2=80=9Csave
some money and put it toward security at these facilities.=E2=80=9D

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., called the 11-hour hearing =E2=80=9Cabusive
=E2=80=9D and
=E2=80=9Cdisrespectful,=E2=80=9D and said House Republicans failed to domain.com
plish what some
in their own ranks have admitted was the purpose of the inquiry.

=E2=80=9CThey certainly didn=E2=80=99t do any damage to Hillary Clinton=E2
=80=99s campaign for
president,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CAnd if that was their goal, they got
 an =E2=80=98F.=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said the effort distracted lawmakers from
pressing policy matters, such as raising the debt domain.com, keeping the
government funded and passing a long-term transportation bill.

On Thursday, as the Benghazi hearing commanded much of the attention of
official Washington, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
approved a six-year bill to authorize road, bridge and domain.com projects,
the first such legislation in a decade.

=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s what the House needs to do,=E2=80=9D Shaheen said. 
=E2=80=9CStop the partisan
maneuvering and get to the work of the country.=E2=80=9D
