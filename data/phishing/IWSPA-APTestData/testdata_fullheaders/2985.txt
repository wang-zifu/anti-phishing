RE: It's Time for a Birthday Lunch!

You are so sweet to keep us honest about celebrations!!  It has been way too long.  Hope everything is good with you.  Things on this end hectic but good.  I’m out for biz a couple of times but give me some choices of dates that work for you and we can go from there.

Look forward to seeing you soon.




p.s. love the Minion!!

Hi Leah,




I can’t believe so many months have gone by already, but now that it is June, it’s your birthday month. Let’s find a time for us to celebrate. I can schedule with Bobbie if that’s easier. Hope all is well on the Sony front and at home.




Take care,

Barbara
