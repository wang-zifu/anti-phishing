"Keep your head up, you'll run faster."  -JDP

Hello Fast and Fabulous!!!

Fortunately, the rain clouds have cleared and we are looking at sunny skies
 for Sunday morning - phew!!

Looking forward to a great race on Sunday. Hopefully, we will all be able t
o connect.

I've included some of the race info below.

Meet up:
Our plan is to try to meet up before the race. Between 8 and 8:15, we will 
meet in Stanton Park, which is directly next to the starting line. Exact me
eting place is in front of the statue on the side closest to the school.

After the race, folks will either be cheering on Maryland Ave at the finish
 line (I expect to see some of you super-fast peeps there as I finish) or w
ill also reassemble in Stanton Park near the bagel table. I hear some folks
 may head to Bagels and Baguettes (at the intersection of Maryland and 3rd)
 after the race, but I won't be able to join that group so leave the organi
zing to someone else.

Packet Pickup:
You can pick up your packet at two different locations:

Friday, May 16th
* Peabody Primary School<<<link>>

am-race start

Sunday packet pick up is a disaster. I don't recommend it!!
**I am heading to packet pick up tonight around 6:30. If anyone needs me to
 grab their number, I am happy to do it and bring it to the statue at Stant
on Park on Sunday morning. BUT I am leaving the statue area no later than 8
:20 to get into the starting line, so if you need me to grab your bib you M
UST get to the statue before then - I will not domain.com.

Race Morning Details:
The race will start from the block in front of Peabody Primary School (425 
C St NE<<<link>>
0dec5f5dcf53ad12bff7&id=3D2f0dcfa3d8&e=3Da253097f06>). Bag check will be av
ailable at the school as well. The race will start at 8:30am.

Getting there:
The closest Metro stop is Union Station. It's about a 4-5 block walk from t
he train. The Classic has also partnered with Uber<<<link>>
c.us6.list-domain.com/track/click?u=3Dec3300dec5f5dcf53ad12bff7&id=3Dbfae9
e37d8&e=3Da253097f06> to offer new riders a free trip to the starting line.
 Just use the promotion code CHClassic when signing up and Uber will give y
ou $30 off your first ride. There are also plenty of bike racks if you pref
er to cycle to the starting line.

I think that is about it. If anyone has any questions, should me a note.

Otherwise, I'll see you all bright and early on Sunday.
Go team!!!
Tamara
