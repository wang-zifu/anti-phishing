RE: A thought...

Matt,

We would definitely look to use these same tags, and simply dub or subtitle, depending on the country. Importantly, these will be seen as we close out the campaign, so that there is a level of awareness of Skylark (the character) from trailers, earlier TV spots, online etc.

I’ll call you on Monday to catch up on the London screening. Have a good weekend.

Best,

Nigel

Hi Nigel-




I hope you had a great weekend.




I wanted to loop you in to something we’re going to do domestically that we’d like to replicate for your key markets.




I’ve cc’d Mike Pavlic on it. 




Please read through and let me know if you have any questions.




Thank you very much.




ML
