RE: A MONSTER CALLS / TriStar Productions

Called that.  As sure as night follows day….   If this gets joined, I suspect we may loose it.  To make our deal as totally safe as it is, the only floor we can quarantee is the left hand art film spend and that will trip his wire re what happened on impossible.   But a big p and a commitment is inconsistent with the level of controls and independence he wants.   Can’t really have it both ways--- unless of course someone else is willing to give it to him.

Couple more things...  Need to know the release commitment.  Floor on the P and A.  And also really need to understand the credits.  We envision there only being executive producing credits.  If that is not the case, we need to know.  Everything factors into the decision.
