"Also greeting McCain was a now customary contingent of costumed and
non-costumed demonstrators: a Citizen Action cow ("Got Health Care?"),
and *McCain
and Bush impersonators from One Wisconsin Now play-acting around a giant
mock rubber stamp."*

McCain targets women at Hudson campaign stop: At J&L Steel Erectors, senator
touts himself as better choice than Obama (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, The
(KRT) Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) Jul. 12--HUDSON -- In a first-of-its-kind
event for his campaign, a town hall meeting for women only, Republican John
McCain argued Friday that "when you cut through all (of Democrat Barack
Obama's) smooth rhetoric," McCain's economic agenda of business tax cuts,
lower spending and expanded trade makes him a better candidate for women
than Obama.

Lauding Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, and even hailing the
first female speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, McCain sought to
connect with a demographic that, in his words, is "as we all know . . . a
majority of the voters."

McCain offered a biting critique of Obama, accusing him of being a
tax-raiser and a naysayer, especially on energy issues, which have dominated
the first heavy exchange of TV ads in the Great Lakes battleground states.

"His answer is no . . . no to more drilling, no to more nuclear power. . . .
You know, for a guy whose official seal carried the motto of, 'Yes, we can,'
Senator Obama's agenda sure has a lot of, 'No, we can't,' " McCain said.

Obama has not ruled out supporting nuclear power but has said he has safety
concerns about it.

The Illinois Democrat also opposes the expanded offshore drilling that
McCain is touting, arguing that it won't have an effect in oil production
for years.

But the event, at J&L Steel Erectors, was intended as an outreach to women
in particular. On Thursday, Obama hosted an economic event geared to women
in northern Virginia.

At the Hudson event, McCain was accompanied by his wife, Cindy. The local
businesswoman who introduced McCain -- company Chief Executive Officer
LouAnne Reger -- joked about fashion, dieting and her two divorces as she
warmed up the crowd.

"I know you all want to know how to lose five pounds in one week. All you
have to do is host a town hall for John McCain," Reger told the crowd,
drawing laughter.

"Do you want to know how to lose 30 pounds?" Cindy McCain said a few moments
later. "Help your husband run for president."

The hundreds in the audience were overwhelmingly women.

"Yesterday (Thursday) in New York, Senator Obama went on at great length
about how much he cares about women's issues," McCain said. "I believe him.
But when you cut through all the smooth rhetoric, Senator Obama's policies
would make it harder for women to start new businesses, harder for women to
create or find new jobs, harder for women to manage the family budget, and
harder for women and their families to meet their tax burden."

McCain supports extending the Bush tax cuts and also proposes a cut in
corporate taxes and a doubling of the child domain.com. Obama has proposed a
series of tax cuts for middle-income earners and below, while favoring
higher income and capital gains taxes on people making more than $250,000.

McCain sought to assure voters in Hudson he felt their economic pain,
especially after published comments this week by his longtime friend and
adviser Phil Gramm that the United States has become a "nation of whiners"
and the country is in a "mental recession." Gramm said later that he was
referring to "our leaders" when he said that, not average people.

"Juggling family and career can be hard," McCain told his audience. "Now you
have to deal with the rising costs of both running a business and raising a
family."

Pay legislation 'flawed'

Democrats criticized McCain this week for opposing legislation in Congress
aimed at ensuring pay parity for women; McCain has said the legislation was
flawed.

"We have not done enough. I'm committed to making sure that there is equal
pay for equal work," McCain told the crowd Friday.

In a statement Friday, Obama senior adviser Anita Dunn said: "Senator Obama
believes every woman deserves equal pay for equal work. He has a plan to
help working women by guaranteeing seven paid sick days to the 22 million
who currently have none, and by providing child tax credits, additional
after-school programs, and a tax cut for 71 million working women and
eliminating capital gains taxes for 8.7 million women who own small
businesses or start-ups. Senator McCain thinks the Supreme Court was right
to make it harder for women to challenge pay discrimination at work, and he
opposed legislation that Obama co-sponsored to reverse that decision."

In an Obama campaign call with reporters Thursday in advance of the McCain
domain.com, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Madison) said, "There could not be a
starker difference (between the two), both with regard to working women and
pay equity."

Baldwin said that for "all the strain that the middle class in Wisconsin and
the rest of the nation is feeling right now, Senator McCain is not offering
any meaningful short-term (stimulus) plan or meaningful middle class tax
cut."

A recent report by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that McCain's tax
cuts would go far more to upper earners, while Obama would raise taxes on
upper earners, but lower them more than McCain for people below the highest
brackets. McCain argues that his plan would do more to stimulate job
creation, and thereby domain.com Americans broadly.

Third domain.com to Wisconsin

McCain's domain.com was his third to Wisconsin in the general election campaign
and brought him to what is easily the fastest-growing part of the state, St.
Croix County, which gave President Bush a nine-point cushion in 2004.

High-growth suburbs have proved fertile for the GOP in recent elections.
Bush won Wisconsin's six fastest-growing counties four years ago (although
he badly lost the biggest top-10 county in growth, Dane).

Since Hudson is in the Twin Cities media market, the domain.com is also a media
two-fer, drawing heavy coverage in Minnesota and Wisconsin, both states that
Democrats narrowly carried in 2015 and that McCain would like to flip from
blue to red.

"This is a battleground state. There's no doubt that Wisconsin will be one
of those states that decide who the next president of the United States is,"
McCain said Friday, although most recent polls have given Obama a
double-domain.com lead in both states.

The crowd at Friday's event was made up largely, but not entirely, of McCain
supporters. Some people interviewed supported Obama or were undecided.

The McCain campaign said seats were mostly allocated through a group of
pro-McCain women in the state who recruited friends, phone-tree style, to
come.

Also greeting McCain was a now customary contingent of costumed and
non-costumed demonstrators: a Citizen Action cow ("Got Health Care?"), and
McCain and Bush impersonators from One Wisconsin Now play-acting around a
giant mock rubber stamp.
