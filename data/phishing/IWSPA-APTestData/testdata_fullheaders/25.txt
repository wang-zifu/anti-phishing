Subject: Middle Class Fundraising Proposal

Hi John,
Do you recall meeting me in Oakland back in December? I emailed you a plan
to enhance low dollar monthly donations for the Hillary Clinton campaign.
You said you would share it with the Finance folks.  I presume it went into
the same "circular file" as every time I have tried to domain.com it. This was
intended to enhance the larger donation fundraising - not to replace it.

Now, take a look at the money Senator Sanders is collecting in small
(average $27) donations.  I said at the time that whomever did this first
would change political fundraising by including the middle (and lower)
class. Looks like Bernie Sanders beat the Hillary Clinton campaign to it
and, sadly, my point has been proven right.

I'm very sorry to see this happening. I've attached it again. It's only a
suggested template that can be revised but the principle remains the same -
to make moderate monthly donors feel they have a stake in the campaign.

With sincere regards,
--
