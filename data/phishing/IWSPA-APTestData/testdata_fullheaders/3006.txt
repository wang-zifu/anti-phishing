Dear John,

We knew Fox News had some dirty tricks up its sleeve, but this newest infor
mation is really low.

Earlier this week, our friends at Media Matters for America reported that t
he managing editor of FOX News' Washington, D.C., office sent an email last
 December=A0-- during the Copenhagen climate talks -- instructing FOX repor
ters to "refrain from asserting that the domain.com has warmed (or cooled) in a
ny given period without IMMEDIATELY pointing out that such theories are bas
ed on data that critics have called into question."

Please "Like" our Facebook page to get up-to-date information about this sh
ocking development and help us counter this blatant right-wing propaganda.

For months, right-wing mouthpieces like Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and Sara
h Palin have tried to erode public support for sound clean energy and clima
te policies by spreading false and misleading information about climate sci
ence. Now we have solid evidence that FOX News orchestrated and supported t
hese efforts to confuse and mislead Americans=A0about the devastating effec
ts of climate change.

We need to aggressively counter the right-wing propaganda machine by first 
exposing their lies and then sharing the real facts about climate change wi
th our family and friends. You can help by "Liking" our Facebook page and s
haring it with all of your friends!

We've had enough! LCV is taking on FOX News and any other media companies t
hat parrot Big Oil's talking points and fail to honestly report on the thre
at posed by the climate crisis. Look for updates on our campaign on Faceboo
k!

Thank you for all that you do for the environment.

Sincerely,

Gene Karpinski
President
League of Conservation Voters
