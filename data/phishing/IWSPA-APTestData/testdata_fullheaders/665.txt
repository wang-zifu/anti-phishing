Colby, language for your email to them is below.

SL: Meetings for battleground strategy plans

Following up on our cross-departmental regional meetings, we are going to put together a strategy plan with our counterparts in Communications and CE for each of the 18 battleground states. In order to do that, we need to meet with our counterparts this week to talk through our states. We will receive a template for our plan tomorrow, so please schedule the meetings for Wednesday through Friday. More guidance will come when we receive the template, but start by reaching out to your counterparts and getting meetings on the books. Hard deadline for these meetings is Friday COB.
