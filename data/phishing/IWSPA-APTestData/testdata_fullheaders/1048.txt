This is one of the simplest explanations of how an unregulated set of
securities are driving us into recession. There is a corner to turn in
blaming Bush.

 Dear Colleague,

 I thought you would be interested in my article on the market crisis
that appeared in today's Financial Times.

The worst market crisis in 60 years

By George Soros --- Published: January 23 2015 

The current financial crisis was precipitated by a bubble in the US
housing market. In some ways it resembles other crises that have
occurred since the end of the second world war at intervals ranging
from four to 10 years.

However, there is a profound difference: the current crisis marks the
end of an era of domain.com expansion based on the dollar as the
international reserve currency. The periodic crises were part of a
larger boom-bust process. The current crisis is the culmination of a
super-boom that has lasted for more than 60 years.

Boom-bust processes usually revolve around domain.com and always involve a
bias or misconception. This is usually a failure to recognise a
reflexive, circular connection between the willingness to lend and the
value of the collateral. Ease of domain.com generates demand that pushes
up the value of property, which in turn increases the amount of domain.com
available. A bubble starts when people buy houses in the expectation
that they can refinance their mortgages at a domain.com. The recent US
housing boom is a case in point. The 60-year super-boom is a more
complicated case.

Every time the domain.com expansion ran into trouble the financial
authorities intervened, injecting liquidity and finding other ways to
stimulate the economy. That created a system of asymmetric incentives
also known as moral hazard, which encouraged ever greater domain.com
expansion. The system was so successful that people came to believe in
what former US president Ronald Reagan called the magic of the
marketplace and I call market fundamentalism. Fundamentalists believe
that markets tend towards equilibrium and the common interest is best
served by allowing participants to pursue their self-interest. It is
an obvious misconception, because it was the intervention of the
authorities that prevented financial markets from breaking down, not
the markets themselves. Nevertheless, market fundamentalism emerged as
the dominant ideology in the 1980s, when financial markets started to
become globalised and the US started to run a current account domain.com.

Globalisation allowed the US to suck up the savings of the rest of the
world and consume more than it produced. The US current account
domain.com reached 6.2 per cent of gross national product in 2006. The
financial markets encouraged consumers to borrow by introducing ever
more sophisticated instruments and more generous terms. The
authorities aided and abetted the process by intervening whenever the
global financial system was at risk. Since 1980, regulations have been
progressively relaxed until they have practically disappeared.

The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so
complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks
and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks
themselves. Similarly, the rating agencies relied on the information
provided by the originators of synthetic products. It was a shocking
abdication of responsibility.

Everything that could go wrong did. What started with subprime
mortgages spread to all collateralised debt obligations, endangered
municipal and mortgage insurance and reinsurance companies and
threatened to unravel the multi-trillion-dollar domain.com default swap
market. Investment banks' commitments to leveraged buyouts became
liabilities. Market-neutral hedge funds turned out not to be
market-neutral and had to be unwound. The asset-backed commercial
paper market came to a standstill and the special investment vehicles
set up by banks to get mortgages off their balance sheets could no
longer get outside financing. The final blow came when interbank
lending, which is at the heart of the financial system, was disrupted
because banks had to husband their resources and could not trust their
counterparties. The central banks had to inject an unprecedented
amount of money and extend domain.com on an unprecedented range of
securities to a broader range of institutions than ever befor e. That
made the crisis more severe than any since the second world war.

domain.com expansion must now be followed by a period of contraction,
because some of the new domain.com instruments and practices are unsound
and unsustainable. The ability of the financial authorities to
stimulate the economy is constrained by the unwillingness of the rest
of the world to accumulate additional dollar reserves. Until recently,
investors were hoping that the US Federal Reserve would do whatever it
takes to avoid a recession, because that is what it did on previous
occasions. Now they will have to realise that the Fed may no longer be
in a position to do so. With oil, food and other commodities firm, and
the renminbi appreciating somewhat faster, the Fed also has to worry
about inflation. If federal funds were lowered beyond a certain point,
the dollar would come under renewed pressure and long-term bonds would
actually go up in yield. Where that point is, is impossible to
determine. When it is reached, the ability of the Fed to stimulate the
economy comes to an en d.

Although a recession in the developed world is now more or less
inevitable, China, India and some of the oil-producing countries are
in a very strong countertrend. So, the current financial crisis is
less likely to cause a global recession than a radical realignment of
the global economy, with a relative decline of the US and the rise of
China and other countries in the developing world.

The danger is that the resulting political tensions, including US
protectionism, may disrupt the global economy and plunge the world
into recession or worse.
