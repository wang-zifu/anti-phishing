SL: OrganizationCommunications Director: Democrats United and Ready to take on Trump

OrganizationCommunications Director User today laid out how Democrats will be united and ready to hold the GOP's presumptive nominee Donald Trump accountable in the general election. Close to three-fourths of Democratic voters in recent primaries have said they're excited by our primary, a testament to the strong and substantive campaigns our candidates have run focused on moving our country forward. The contrast couldn't be clearer with dangerous Donald Trump whose offensive and divisive campaign has already begun to alienate even our closest allies.
