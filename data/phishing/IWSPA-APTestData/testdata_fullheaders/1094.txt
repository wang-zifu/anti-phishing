Trump on Breitbart Radio Earlier today:

HRC will be easy to beat
- Bad on jobs and the border

Clintons have $100 million. Just influence peddling?
- To get to those numbers, they got paid for a fortune for speeches
- Look at the countries and companies they gave speeches for and look how they got treated in government
- She took money and did favors for it. No doubt

Met with president of Northern League of Italy. Refugee Crisis?
- Crisis is horrible. Should have built safe zones
- Germany will never be the same

Koch's comments comparing your anti-Muslim rhetoric to Nazis
- I've always liked the Kochs. Members of my Palm Beach club
- I don't need their money
- Disagree with what he says
- He doesn't like me because I'm one of the few that doesn't need his money
- Who knows how well he is doing because he is in the oil business and the business is down
