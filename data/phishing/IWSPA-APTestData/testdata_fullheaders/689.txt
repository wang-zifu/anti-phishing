Ralph Steadman is the last of the original Gonzo visionaries…




Made over the course of fifteen years, “For No Good Reason” explores the connection between life and art through the eyes of seminal British artist, Ralph Steadman. Insightful, humorous and visually stunning, this is a study in honesty, friendship and the ambition that drives an artist.




Ralph’s rise to prominence began in the early 1970’s during the fallout from the love and hope that had swept the western world during the 1960’s. This legendary time for music, literature, art and philosophy was the catalyst, along with his developing relationship with writer Hunter S. Thompson, for Ralph to express and chart the wreckage that followed; a large-scale disintegration of a demoralized counter-culture. His art gained recognition in the press and popular-culture publications, both in the U.K. and the U.S., for its bold comment on his fiercely heart-felt politics.




The film is a richly creative, visual feast about the power and importance of art to achieve Steadman’s aim “I learnt to draw…to try to change the world”. Director Charlie Paul spent 15 years meticulously amassing the footage and creating the remarkable animations for the film to match the same anarchic energy, anger and free domain.com of Steadman’s pictures. Through Johnny Depp’s lead in this intimate domain.com, we are able to reach to the heart of what makes this artist tick, his friendships and fallings out, his love for art and his passion for civil liberties.




“For No Good Reason” is riot of stories and images as we take a trip though the wild and dark days of Steadman’s time with ‘Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas’ writer Hunter S. Thompson, the Rumble in the Jungle; gun fights with literary giant William S. Burroughs and his fiercely heart-felt politics.

This is an inventive, energetic, occasionally harrowing, but inspiring and uplifting film with contributions from Terry Gilliam, Richard E. Grant and music from Slash, All American Rejects, Jason Mraz, James Blake, Ed Harcourt and Crystal Castles, all For No Good Reason.
