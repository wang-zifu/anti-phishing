Fwd: A Sheet of Plywood

Amy – 

When we talk about the stakes of this election, I think of my friend and hero, John Bennett. 

Staff Sergeant Bennett says I went to bat for him – but he’s the one who put it all on the line for our country. I’m humbled that he’s now fighting back against the swiftboat attacks on my record. 

We need all Montanans to hear SSG Bennett’s message because this race is too important to lose. If that happens, the Tea Party will take control of the Senate. 

His message is so important for Montanans to hear – will you help keep it on the air by donating $5 now, before our big public FEC deadline on June 30? 

If you've saved payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Express Donate: $5

Express Donate: $25

Express Donate: $50

Or click here to donate another amount before the FEC deadline.

Thank you so much for your support. 

John Walsh 

PS: We’re just days away from the latest fundraising deadline. Can you help keep SSG Bennett’s message on the air and show the other side exactly what they’re up against?

Walsh for Montana 

Donate to keep John's new ad on the air! Contribute.Dear Friends, 

When I deployed to Iraq with John Walsh, we expected more than a sheet of plywood to defend our Humvees against sniper fire. 

But at the time, the Pentagon treated National Guard troops like second-class soldiers, and our substandard equipment failed to keep me safe. 

I’ll spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair – but John Walsh fought to make sure others wouldn’t. He demanded that Washington give us the resources we needed to be safe on the battlefield. 

So when I see Super PACs swiftboat John’s record – in a callous attempt to take control of the Senate – I wonder, where’s the accountability? 

I’m sharing my story to help John Walsh fight back – and we need your help, too. Will you contribute today to keep my message on the air?
