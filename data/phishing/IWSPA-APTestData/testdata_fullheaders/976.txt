You heard it straight from the source.

Brad's race is a pure "TOSS UP". If we don't fight back, Republicans will 
pounce at the opportunity to attack.

So we need your urgent support to keep this seat blue.

As of 1pm, we're just 81 donations short of our FEC goal. Can Brad count 
on your support?

John, I'm sorry for emailing so much.

But we need more Democrats like Brad Schneider in Congress. Here's why:

Brad believes women deserve equal pay for equal work.
Brad believes all Americans should be able to marry the person they love.
Brad believes our Great Lakes must be protected from polluting companies.
We can re-elect Brad -- and hand Speaker Boehner a devastating defeat -- 
but we need your support immediately.

So I need a quick favor: Will you pitch in $5 or more to help keep Brad 
fighting for Illinois?
