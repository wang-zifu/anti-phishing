*New TV Ad: McCain's Famous Catchphrase *

*"My Friends" Tied To Big Oil Lobbyists *

* *

McCain's Economic and Energy Policies Promise Americans Four More Years of
the Same

A new hard-hitting 30-second television ad released today says John McCain'
s
campaign is run by lobbyists, many from the oil and gas industry. The ad,
released by domain.com Political Action, riffs off McCain's famous "my
friends" line to remind voters exactly who McCain's real friends are. Polls
show concern about gas prices and the economy continue to be top voting
issues =96 and that McCain's ties to lobbyists and big oil can hurt him wit
h
independent voters.

"With the economy on the skids and gas prices high, we can't afford a McCai
n
Presidency paid for by Big Oil," said Eli Pariser, Executive Director of
MoveOn. "McCain's campaign, stacked with lobbyists from Big Oil, promises
four more years of the same Bush economic and energy policies."

MoveOn will spend at least $200,000 to run "My Friends" on national cable
and in some battleground states.
