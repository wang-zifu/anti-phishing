Once in a
while there comes an opportunity that is too good to pass.This time has
come again. R*N*B*I is a diamond in the rough and this undervalued company is about
to make us all very wealthy.Our peers will look up to us and say "wow he's
smart".That's because if we can buy R*N*B*I for about 20 cents today we will
likely get 5x our investment as analysts are predicting it will reach a dollar
in the coming weeks.TThere's also a bit of history behind this.Just a few
weeks ago the company was at 35 cents!It has taken one step back and is getting
ready to make 5 steps forward and we are lucky to be able to buy shares for as
cheap as 20 cents right now.It's not every day that a legal cannabis company
can be bought for so cheap.If we look at the historical chart and
analysts' recommendations this looks like the perfect buy right now and I would
get as many shares as I can at the current prices.
