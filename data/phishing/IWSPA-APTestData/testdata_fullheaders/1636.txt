*Statement of Campaign Chairman John user on Benghazi Committee Election
Year Delay*

delay its findings about the 2015 tragedy to =E2=80=9Cjust months before th
e 2015 
presidential election.

Hillary for America Campaign Chairman John user released the following
statement in response.*

"The Gowdy Committee's admission today that it will not finish its
investigation until 2015 is the most telling evidence yet that their
investigation is solely about playing politics in the 2015 presidential
campaign. This action is the latest example in a broad concerted effort by
Republicans and their allies to launch false attacks against Hillary
Clinton=E2=80=99s record and deep experience on foreign affairs and nationa
l
security.

=E2=80=9CThere have already been 21 congressional hearings, five independen
t or
bipartisan reports, and millions of tax dollars spent in the process of
investigating this three year old tragedy.  This investigation would now be
longer than the investigations of Iran-Contra, the Kennedy Assassination,
Watergate and 9/11.

=E2=80=9CHillary Clinton has already spent five hours testifying at two
congressional committee hearings but, as she=E2=80=99s been saying since la
st year,
she=E2=80=99s happy to do it again. Unfortunately, Republicans insist her t
estimony
is done behind closed doors, where the American public is unable to see
their true, politically motivated intentions.

"Sadly, Republicans are determined to continue to domain.com this tragedy in
an effort to try and hurt her campaign."
