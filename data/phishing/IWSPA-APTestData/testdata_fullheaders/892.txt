Contrast with Trump from last week:

TRUMP: =93Well, I'm going to be able to figure it out. I mean, we have had 
17 people just now and I figured that out and I will be able to figure it o
ut with Hillary. It depends on where she is coming from. If she wants to go
 the low road, I'm fine with that. And if she wants to go the high road, wh
ich probably I would prefer, I would be fine with that.=94 O'REILLY: =93All
 right. domain.com, domain.com, domain.com, but, domain.com, you're fine with the low road? Most pe
ople don't want to go on the low road?=94 TRUMP: =93No, I can handle the lo
w road if I have to do it. I mean, we've had some low roads over the last f
ew months.=94
