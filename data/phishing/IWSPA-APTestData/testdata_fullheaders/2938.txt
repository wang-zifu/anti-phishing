Trump in Bridgeport at 12:30pm

(Trump was pumped up)

Only really have 1 opponent
 - Cruz and Kasich are each 1/2
- Why is Kasich still in?

Trade
- TPP and NAFTA are killing us
- TPP will be worse

Omnibus budget
- Trillions of dollars in debt

Mentions Tom Brady

Gives a shoutout to staff
- Manafort, Lewandowki, and Hicks

I'm a smart guy
- Went to the best school
- I'm like really smart

Crooked Hillary
Bernie is over
- Unless Hillary is indicted

Trump claims Bill O'Reilly is "straight down the middle"
- Has no friendships, no nothing

Slowest trigger on foreign policy

New Hampshire
- Heroin problem
- Didn't mesh with landscape

If I don't win CT, I'm moving to Alabama

Cruz can't win in voting
- Has zero personality
- Lies like a thief

(Walk off music comes on before Trump is done)

Usual close
