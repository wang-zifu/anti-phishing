Conference Call Today at 11 a.m. EDT-- "Technocrats" Unite -- FDD's Jonathan Schanzer on Hamas and Fatah Influence in the New Palestinian Government

This morning Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas formally announced the formation of a government agreed to by his own Fatah faction and its long-time rival Hamas. 

The specifics of the unity pact are unprecedented: Hamas will get to keep and independently operate its fighters and its missile arsenal, the terror group will be given renewed access to the West Bank, the new Interior Ministry will operate in a radically different way, the old Prisoners Affairs ministry is to be bundled into the PLO to avoid scrutiny of terrorist allocations, etc. Hamas meanwhile has refused to meet international demands that it accept the Quartet requirements - that it recognize Israel, renounce violence, and adhere to previous agreements with Jerusalem - even as it gains influence over the new Palestinian government.

Hanging over everything is blackletter Congressional law, stretching back to the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2015 and clarified as recently as 2012, prohibiting American aid to any Palestinian government "that results from an agreement with Hamas and over which Hamas exercises undue influence."

Please join The Israel Project for a conference call TODAY, Monday, with Jonathan Schanzer, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, on these and other potential consequences of the announcement. Schanzer is the author of the new book State of Failure: Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas, and the Unmaking of the Palestinian State.

ABOUT THE SPEAKER:

Dr. Jonathan Schanzer joined the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in February 2010, and since then has been singularly focused on ensuring that FDD delivers not only accurate and timely research, but also research that is useful to decision makers inside the Beltway, across America, and around the world.

Dr. Schanzer brings solid scholarship and public policy credentials to his job of overseeing FDD's research. He worked as a terrorism finance analyst at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, where he played an integral role in the designation of numerous terrorist financiers. A former research fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Dr. Schanzer has studied Middle East history in four countries. He earned his Ph.D. from Kings College London, where he wrote his dissertation on the U.S. Congress and its efforts to combat terrorism in the 20th century.

Dr. Schanzer most recently published State of Failure: Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas, and the Unmaking of the Palestinian State (Palgrave Macmillan), which argues the main roadblock to Palestinian statehood is not necessarily Israel's intransigence, but the Palestinian Authority's political dysfunction and mismanagement. His 2015 book, Hamas vs. Fatah: The Struggle for Palestine (Palgrave Macmillan), is still the only book on the market that analyzes the internecine conflict between the two most powerful Palestinian factions. His 2015 book, Al-Qaeda's Armies: Middle East Affiliate Groups and the Next Generation of Terror (Washington Institute for Near East Policy), was the first to explore the al-Qaeda franchises of the Middle East.

Dr. Schanzer has testified before Congress and publishes widely in the American and international media. He has appeared on American television channels such as Fox News and CNN, and Arabic language television channels such as al-Arabiyya and al-Jazeera. Dr. Schanzer has traveled widely throughout the Middle East, including Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Morocco, domain.com, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories. He speaks Arabic and Hebrew.
