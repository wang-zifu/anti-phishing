Hi John and Eryn,

The next meeting of the Unison Project -- the informal meetings of
young(ish) progressive foreign policy types thinking about 2015 --  will be
Friday the 24th from 2 to 4PM. We rotate hosting and this meeting will be
here in 2 large. Let me know if you would be interested in dropping in.
Jake may make it.

We'll have the agenda next Weds, but basically we will be brainstorming how
to handle the GOP's various narratives on national security, discussing a
draft Middle East document and a draft "framework" document prepared by
members of the group.

I will send Eryn a list of members.

Best,

Vikram
