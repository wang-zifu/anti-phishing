Dear John,

We are in the closing stretch of our campaign and on the verge of a historic win.

Sestak 54% - Specter 37%!  

We lead by 17 points among Democrats who can identify both Arlen and me, in a just released poll.  Great news ? but we still have a further way to go.  We're unknown by about half of the Democratic voters, which will soon be remedied by our field operations and paid media in the closing weeks. 



To help raise the funds needed to reach the remaining Democrats, I'm asking you to please attend an upcoming fundraiser.  This reception is hosted by Michael Levy and Bonny Wolf at their home in Washington DC on Tuesday, March 23rd from 5:00pm - 7:00pm (see invitation below).



Political experts nationwide have reached the same verdict that Specter is imperiled:

    * The Hill declares Specter "the most imperiled incumbent in the Senate."

    * Politico reports that "no incumbent in the House or Senate has a longer or tougher road to re-election."

    * The Rothenberg Political Report, The Cook Report, and Congressional Quarterly have all down-graded Specter's changes for re-election to "toss-up" with Congressional Quarterly going further in stating "and that's being generous to Specter".




And two of our state's major newspapers have called us the future of the Democratic Party:

    * "Arlen Specter ... isn't the future of the Democratic Party - but his May primary opponent, the relentless U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak, is". -- Pittsburgh Tribune-Review

    * "You don't encounter people like this every day. When you do, you have to seize the moment ... Sestak's heart is emblazoned on his sleeve ? there is a refreshing sincerity ... passion smolders underneath this former Navy Admiral, who served in the Clinton Administration ? It is clear that Specter ... has become yesterday's news ... He needs to domain.com ... his time has come and gone. And Joe Sestak's time is now." -- The Times Herald

This is our last full-fundraising quarter before the May primary.  What we raise now, can make all the difference in winning this race!



I am asking you to attend and make the maximum contribution possible for you.  If you are not able to attend, I would be most appreciative of your considering making a contribution now.  Checks are made payable to "Sestak For Senate" and mailed to Sestak For Senate; P.O. Box 1936; Media, PA 19063 or made online:  Please click here: <<link>>

Warmly,
Joe

Michael Levy & Bonny Wolf
