Think Like A Man Too Tracking - June 5th

Today Think Like A Man Too sees good gains in unaided, but otherwise remains similar to what we saw on Monday. This is good news considering Transformers came on tracking today, and though it debuts with 17% first choice among the African-American audience, our first choice held steady. Overall we are at 15% unaided (+3), 90% total awareness, 66% definite interest, and 20% first choice.




Our unaided is better than any of our comps, which is a great sign that we’re top of mind despite the competitive marketplace. We have all the tools we need to grow definite interest over the next couple weeks, and while first choice weathered its toughest storm today, we will likely need to domain.com until our opening week to see how strong we really are in that measure. 




African-Americans Overall

TLAM2: 15/90/66/20

TLAM: 13/84/73/32

Ride Along: 9/80/70/24

Best Man Holiday: 11/82/69/25




African-American Males

TLAM2: 9/88/64/17

TLAM: 9/78/61/22

Ride Along: 13/85/67/26

Best Man Holiday: 8/71/61/17




African-American Females

TLAM2: 21/91/68/24

TLAM: 17/90/82/41

Ride Along: 4/76/74/21

Best Man Holiday: 15/93/75/34




Among the general audience 17-34 Transformers didn’t hurt us, and we make some nice gains, driven primarily by females. Today we have 4% unaided, 60% total aware (+2), 40% definite interest, and 8% first choice (+2). Again, this shows great growth from the original film, which registered 2% unaided, 42% total aware, 37% definite interest, and 6% first choice in the same frame. 




Looking at the marketplace, Jump Street continues to impress (12/87/52/15 with general, 14/91/58/13 among African-Americans), and Transformers has a great debut (8/87/53/13 with general, 8/89/70/17 among African-Americans). However, on our weekend there is nothing to distract from Think Like A Man Too, as Jersey Boys fails to register with the general audience (1/59/26/3) or the African-American audience (1/58/26/1). 




We still have nearly 70% of our media left to run. The NBA Finals are sure to go at least four games, and we will be on every one of them, starting this evening. Let’s hope for a long series that we can ride right into our opening weekend. Other network hits tonight include Hollywood Game Night, and Gang Related. Closing out the week and over the weekend we will be on Sportscenter, 106 & Park, the premiere of Keeping up with the Kardashians, American Dad, and much more. 




Online we have stunts across BET, Complex, MediaTakeout, VH1, NBA, and Bossip. Next week, we have takeovers on NBA, ESPN Mobile and Video Sponsorship, VH1, BET, Global Grind, the 106 & Park App, and we’ll begin our “Battle of the Sexes” theme week on VEVO with custom playlists. Our cast has also been very active on social as they travel around the country promoting the movie. 




This Saturday Kevin will be on Spike’s Guys Choice Awards, accepting the award for King of Comedy. This Saturday is also our press junket, where we’ll have complete cast participation including Kevin Hart, Regina Hall, Terrence J, Gabrielle Union, Jerry Ferrara, Meagan Good, Romany Malco, Taraji P. Henson, Michael Ealy, Gary Owen, and LaLa Anthony. 




As big blockbusters pop up on tracking, Think Like A Man Too continues to prove it has earned its place in summer. Let’s keep working, we’ve got two more weeks until we really make some noise.
