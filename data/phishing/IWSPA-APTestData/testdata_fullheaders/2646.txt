Wally:

You are our secret weapon in navigating so many years of construction.  In 
the early days you and Dick Chused were the law professor/architects. Your 
book, Construction Notes, will be an indispensable part of the law school h
istory.

I thank you for this important contribution.

Emma

Dear Wally, Thank you for your active engagement with this construction pro
ject. Your involvement is a major reason why, "Despite the enormity of the 
project, our lives have been, for the most part, minimally disrupted."  As 
the year draws to a close, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf o
f the entire community.

Thank you, as well, for these Construction Notes. Among your countless gift
s, you are a skilled urban historian, and it is fascinating to read an acco
unt like this.

Best, Bill
