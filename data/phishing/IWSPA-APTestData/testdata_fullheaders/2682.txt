Amy,

With the beginning of each year comes the start of proxy season for many public companies. I want to make you aware of two recent NACD publications that you may find helpful as you prepare your company's 2015 compensation discussion and analysis (CD&A) statement.

NACD Perspectives: Supplemental Pay Definitions
This paper details NACD's point of view on executive pay-for-performance principles as well as definitions for realized and realizable pay. 

Preparing the 2015 CD&A: Priority Considerations for Boards
In support of exemplary board performance, NACD has a responsibility to bring to the corporate director community the views of key constituents in the capital markets. Based on NACD's conversations with major institutional shareholders that account for a combined $10.2 trillion in assets under management, this paper highlights key issues for compensation committees and boards to consider in preparation for completing 2015 CD&A statements.

I believe you and your board will find this information useful. I invite you to join NACD and receive practical guidance for your board on a regular basis. Additionally, you will gain access to NACD insights, tools, resources, peer exchange forums, director credential program, and our prestigious network of more than 14,000 board members to help you lead with the highest standard of excellence. 

Through Feb. 28, 2014, take advantage of a 20% savings on NACD Full Board Membership. With this savings, the annual investment is $6,000 for 10 directors and executives. (Individual Director Memberships are available for $775.) For more information or assistance in joining, please contact me or reply to this message.

We look forward
