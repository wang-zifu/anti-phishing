I don't know who is the new Sean so sending to you. The Hill just called about a piece on DWS & Sanders back and forth. I did, everyone is heated. Criticism is unfair. Party is fair. She's an easy scapegoat for campaigns that are floundering. Democratically elected chair, etc.

I gave her Eric Walker's info. She said she called/emailed User but hadn't heard back.

Just FYI.
