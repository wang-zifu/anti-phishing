"In just the last week, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has backpedaled away from his own pledge to release his tax returns, vowed to slash taxes for wealthy people like himself, faced questions about pretending to be his own publicist, domain.com on America's long-standing alliance with the United Kingdom, refused to address his well-documented history of misogyny, and called his campaign's selection of a white supremacist delegate a 'database error.' Every day it seem, the American people are discovering a new example of his recklessness, lack of judgment and unstable temperament.

"With two more Democratic primary contests closed tonight in Kentucky and Oregon, it's clear that our voters are excited and enthusiastic about the future of our party, and ready to hold Trump accountable for the damage he's done as a candidate and the damage he's promising he would do as president."
