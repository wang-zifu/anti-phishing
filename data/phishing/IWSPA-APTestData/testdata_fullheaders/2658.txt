Dee Dee has always had a way with words, and once again, she's right on the money -- the best way to celebrate last week's historic moments is by getting right back to work.

If we want a House of Representatives that puts people ahead of politics -- and ideas ahead of ideology -- we've got to put the Speaker's gavel back in Nancy Pelosi's hands. If we want to keep our firewall of Democratic women senators, hold the GOP accountable, and stand up for our progressive ideals, we've got to re-elect Jeanne Shaheen and Kay Hagan. And if we want a last line of defense against the War on Women in the states, we must fight to elect Democratic women governors. And we've got to start today.

Now's your chance to become an EMILY's List member for the special, limited-time rate of just $10. If we want to make history again in 2015 and 2014, the heavy lifting starts today. 

We've shown the world what we can accomplish when we come together behind our strong, pro-choice Democratic women. We can do it -- and more -- again, but not without you.Join the fight by locking in your EMILY's List membership today for just $10. 

Thanks for being a part of this dedicated and inspiring community.

All the best,

Amy K. Dacey

Executive Director

Amy,

Like you, I spent the wee hours of Wednesday, November 7th glued to my TV and Twitter feed, watching one pro-choice Democratic woman after another move into the "WIN" column.

I had never been more proud to be a member of the EMILY's List community -- until now. 

An all-time high of twenty women -- including newly elected Senators like Elizabeth Warren, Mazie Hirono, and Tammy Baldwin -- took the floor of the U.S. Senate. And 16 new pro-choice Democratic congresswomen were sworn into the most diverse and inclusive House in history.

 Yes, this week we celebrate -- and then we get back to work. We've got to re-elect Senators Kay Hagan and Jeanne Shaheen, while recruiting the candidates who will help us take back the House and win key governors' races in 2014. We've got to make critical early investments in research and training. And we can't do any of it without you.

House Republicans are already back to putting politics ahead of people -- risking dire consequences during fiscal cliff negotiations before threatening to turn their backs on those affected by Hurricane Sandy. They even went so far as to end the session without reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. If John Boehner's stumbling and Eric Cantor's sniping are what Republicans call leadership, it's time for a new leader -- and I have a particular Bay Area progressive powerhouse in mind. 




That's right, we need to get the Speaker's gavel back into Nancy Pelosi's capable hand -- and elect the women who will fight for women, families, and our progressive values while holding Republicans accountable for their reckless, retread agenda.

We can do all of this -- and make history again in 2015 -- but only if you join the fight and become an EMILY's List member today for the special rate of just $10.

If you like the sound of "Speaker Pelosi" -- and want to send the Far Right packing in 2015 -- lock in your EMILY's List membership today for just $10. 

EMILY's List has been in front of the pack year after year - recruiting top candidates, helping lead the conversation about progress and priorities, and turning out the women voters who put Democrats over the top.

That's why I'm standing with EMILY's List today. They're smart, innovative, and unrelenting -- and the challenges we face heading into 2015 and 2015 require nothing less. I hope you'll join us by becoming an EMILY's List member today.

Thanks for all you've done to make this historic week possible.

Sincerely

Dee Dee Myers
