1.        I thought it was fine last night.  She did well (but clearly not 
the big win of Vegas); probably O'Malley had the best night (that's not so 
bad for us); and the only thing that would have been awful - a Sanders brea
k out - didn't happen.  So all in all, we were fine.

2.        My lessons learned were:  (1) If she says something three times a
s an aside during practice (Wall Street supports me due to 9/11), we need t
o assume she will say it in the debate, and tell her not to do so; (2) As m
uch as no one wants to hear it, we need to have more prep time for the next
 debate - not as much as the first, but more than we did this time; (3) tha
t prep time can't all be crammed at the end.

3.       Finally, I hate to bug you, but one last time, can I ask you to gi
ve Robby a nudge on my daughter re: Brooklyn.  She interviewed with Adrienn
e for a job doing surrogates - Adrienne loves her.  The job actually exists
, they need to hire someone, Adrienne wants to hire her - it's on Robby's d
esk.  I'm not asking anyone to make a job, or put her in some place where s
he isn't wanted - it just needs a nudge over the finish line.   Think of al
l the money I'm saving the campaign as a volunteer - and I'm paying my OWN 
travel bills.  And I pissed off a 30-year friend to join.  I'm value add!  
 She has to say yes/no to a job at HHS this week, so if Robby could just gi
ve this the nod quickly, that would be awesome.

Many thanks, John!

Ron
