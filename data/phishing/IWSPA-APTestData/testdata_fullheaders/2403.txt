FIRST: Nancy Pelosi emailed you about our final media buy deadline we're 
facing at midnight.

THEN: HILLARY CLINTON EMAILED YOU.

SINCE THEN: A DONOR STEPPED UP AND AGREED TO MATCH ALL DONATIONS BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT UP TO $50,000!

John, our media buy deadline is just 7 hours away. If you're able to 
donate, honestly, there has never been a time it would go this far. Every 
dollar in the door before midnight will go out the door tomorrow to defend 
Democrats in tight races against the late flood of GOP money.

Can you click here and donate before it's too late?
