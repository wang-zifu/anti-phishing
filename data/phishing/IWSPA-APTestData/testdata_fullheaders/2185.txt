Hi everyone. Just wanted to give you a heads up that I'd like to go to my brother's graduation in Minnesota the first week of June. I think I'll take off Friday and Monday (June 3 and 6), and potentially part of that Thursday if the flights are a lot cheaper to leave then. I'm hoping to book my flight soon before prices go up so let me know if anyone has issues. I can definitely be online while I'm away. Thanks for understanding!
