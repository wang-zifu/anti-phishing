Re: 48 A Ladbroke Grove W11 2PA 

Dear Willie,

Many thanks for visiting the flat and for your note and proposal. We have been thinking about how we want to handle the redecorating and refurbishing and decided that we would like to do it more gradually and more casually then what we had first thought.  We are now thinking that we will put in some beds and get the "feel" of the place for half a year and then decide on how extensively we want to work on the place. Given that it probably does not make sense to work together at this time. Again thank you very much for being so considerate and I look forward to speaking in the future. 

Regards 

Michael
