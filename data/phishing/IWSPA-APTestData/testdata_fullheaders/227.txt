   You likely saw Nancy  Pelosi's comments praising Sen Sanders for bringing
 millennials into the political  process and saying they only wanted fairnes
s and opportunity.
   I think this is the perfect tone to take with these voters.
   I have been dismayed  in the last few weeks to see both Pres and Sec Clin
ton talk about these voters as wanting impossible things, or as Mitt Romney m
ight say, free things.
   I do 't see how this language helps at all.
   Sec Clinton does not need millennials  to win the nomination. She may nee
d them to win the election. They should be embraced
