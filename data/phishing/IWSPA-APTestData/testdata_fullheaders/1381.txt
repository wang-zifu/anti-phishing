Within hours of Comcast announcing its acquisition of Time Warner Cable, public advocate groups have come out strongly against the deal.  We can only guess that the DOJ and FCC would also have sent discouraging messages to Comcast like they have done to Sprint and T-Mobile, if Comcast had approached the regulators before announcing this deal. Nevertheless Comcast launched the bid anyway, which might no t only further embolden Softbank CEO Masa Son to do the same but it also likely expands and strengthens his argument in front of regulators and ultimately a judge that could decide their fate.  While we expect little out of DirecTV, which seems content with buying its stock while the industry transforms around it, Charlie Ergen of Dish will undoubtedly look for ways to domain.com an FCC and DOJ whose plate is suddenly about to get very full.
