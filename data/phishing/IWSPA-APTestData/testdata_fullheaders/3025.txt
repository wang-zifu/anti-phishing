=80=A6? You bet, they are for it.
Climate change caused by humans=E2=80=A6? They don't believe the science.
NY Tea Parties...? Watch them pander.

Who am I talking about? The three radical Republicans that could potentiall
y run against Kirsten.

With a toxic national environment for Democrats, any one of these men could
 be the voice of NY. The only way to make a difference is to out communicat
e them in October, and to do that we will need your continued support. *Thi
s cycle you have been generous enough to give $1000.* With 7 days to go bef
ore the primary deadline, you can still give $3800 to reach a total of $4,8
00. Any amount is appreciated. Below are a number of wonderful events in NY
C, Westchester, and across the country. Click here to contribute today and 
then come to one of them this fall. [ <<link>>
