Subject: Fighting For The New Year

::: ProgressNow - Advancing Progressive Agendas, State by State ::: 

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

This should come as no surprise to those who know us - but
we're already geared up for the coast-to-coast Statehouse and
Federal fights of 2013.

The list of issues we'll be working is long and includes
corporate accountability, exposing the corrupt cycle of ALEC,
promoting worker's rights, preventing gun violence, getting fair
state budgets, protecting women's health and pushing renewable
energy initiatives.

Of course, we'll also just do what needs to be done in taking on
the bad guys when they act up. And if 2015 is any indication, we know
that will keep us pretty busy.

Remember our Virginia affiliate's Executive Director's
exchange with the VA Speaker of the House, our Missouri's
affiliate's pushback on their legislature's plan to put a
bust of Rush Limbaugh in the MO statehouse or ousting the Georgia
Senate Majority Leader from GA Senate Leadership?

We'll be sharing the first of the 2015 work of our states later
this month. So no need to worry about this year's state fights
in the ProgressNow network. We're on it.

Happy New Year,

Denise Cardinal
