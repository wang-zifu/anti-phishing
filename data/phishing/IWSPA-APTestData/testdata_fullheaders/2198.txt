-          Will call Zac.

-          Story is on "the Democratic battle plan against Donald Trump, now that he's officially the presumptive GOP nominee. I've talked to folks at Emily's List, Priorities and the Clinton campaign and was hoping to talk to someone at the Organizationas well. Do you know who could chat for this story? We can always start on background and then see what's suitable on the record after."
