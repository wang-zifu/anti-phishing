Okay, couldn't the Bridge booked. Would you be willing to host it in your pods?

Thanks!

Hi Rachel!

Is there any possibility that the Comms Week Ahead meeting can be moved on Friday June 3rd from the Training Room? I've placed a Hold on the Bridge for it. The Digital Team is in need of the Training Room that day.

Talk soon,
Julie
