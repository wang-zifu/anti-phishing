had a bit of a blow up with sloane

I had to lay out reality for him. He doesn't like reality.

He says 32.5 doesn't work and MAYBE if ridley takes 8.5 and will gets 34, then the principle works (in jason's mind will is 20 fdg and ridley is 5fdg, so if 42.5 points are available, jason is saying will should get 20/25ths or 80%x42.5 = 34pts.)Â 

Mike will try to get ridley to take 8.5pts so will can get 34 instead of 32.5, but (A) who knows and (B) omg!!!!!

Meanwhile, no deal yet.
