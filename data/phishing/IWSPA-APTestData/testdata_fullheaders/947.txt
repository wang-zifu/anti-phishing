Hi guys

So I wanted to ask you something I was told: that the Sanders campaign sent the Organizationrules and bylaws committee some kind of email or complaint about the Nevada Democratic Party ahead of the primary charging that the party wasn't following the state rules for the convention. This happened before the convention, I'm told, and didn't really domain.com any action since the convention hadn't happened yet. You guys know anything about that?
