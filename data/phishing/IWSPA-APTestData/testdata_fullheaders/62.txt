I know, I loved that couch...next time, haha!Which of the side table options did you like, the Perspex with the glass inserts then? I love those.Or the glass ones with the chrome legs that can change shape?Thanks.KiriKiri BarkerTrend and Fayrewww.trendandfayre.com +44 7789937838On 21 Oct 2014, at 16:24, "Lynton, Michael" <user@domain.com> wrote:they are fantastic. go for it.  love the couch too.  but not sure where that would go.On Oct 21, 2014, at 8:09 AM, Kiri Barker <user@domain.com> wrote:Hi,Hope you are both well. On my way to the airport as we speak, off to India. But before I go, I wanted to show you these things l found. This mirror is amazing. Such a great shape and the perfect size for above the fireplace mantle in the master bedroom.And then there are a pair of these great vintage Italian perpex side tables with real glass insert tops. Could be good for the living room.Or these two glass side tables (excuse the mass of cables and wires - not great styling in this shop!) with chrome legs, you can see in the pic that you can set them in two ways, one version makes them a bit higher but the lower way of setting them means you could have a glass shelf put in the middle for books etc. They are vintage French and the shop selling them is convinced they are by a well know French architect (who I now can't remember!!!) but since they cannot be sure, they are selling them as though they are made by an unknown. Please let me know what you think ASAP if possible and I'll get them reserved/ bought straight away.Thanks so much.Kiri <image.jpeg><photo 2.JPG><image.jpeg><image.jpeg>Kiri BarkerTrend and Fayrewww.trendandfayre.com +44 7789937838
