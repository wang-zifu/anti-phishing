Dear John,

The epidemic of police killings of unarmed Black males has become one of th
e most pressing issues facing the country. I am writing you with a time-urg
ent appeal to help get justice for Tamir Rice, the 12-year old boy shot and
 killed by Cleveland police last year. =C2=A0

Rather than aggressively pursuing justice for Tamir and his family, Clevela
nd prosecutor Tim McGinty is bending over backwards to protect the officers
 who did the shooting.=C2=A0 I explain the issues in THIS PIECE <<<link>>
domain.com/@stevepwrites/tamirrice-cleveland-prosecutor-should-question-the-c
ops-3a3f0dd83e46#.5m8v9rwq6>. The bottom line is that McGinty has allowed t
he officers who shot Tamir to present their side of the story to the grand 
jury, but he won't cross-examine them, wrongly claiming they have asserted 
their 5th Amendment Rights.=C2=A0

Please take one minute to call the prosecutor's office and tell them your n
ame and that you want McGinty to question the cops who killed Tamir. Here i
s the number -=C2=A0216.443.7800. <>

Thank you for everything you do.

In Solidarity,

Steve Phillips
