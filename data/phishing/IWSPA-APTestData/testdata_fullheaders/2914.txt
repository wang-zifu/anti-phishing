Think Like A Man Tracking - June 12th

Think Like A Man Too again sees gains in key heat measures, and today posts 21% unaided (+2), 94% total awareness (+2), 68% definite interest, and 25% first choice (+1). 




Definite interest among males pops back up for us today and is at its highest level to date. While our definite interest overall narrowly trails Ride Along and Best Man Holiday, the fact that our awareness is better than those films by a good margin means we have a larger number of total moviegoers interested in our film than our comps. This summer first choice has been surging very close to opening, but even if we have to domain.com until next Thursday to see our true strength, we have continued to grow that measure despite the competition and we’re in a great place.   




African-Americans Overall

TLAM2: 21/94/68/25

TLAM: 21/91/61/31

Ride Along: 16/85/70/34

Best Man Holiday: 19/81/70/26




African-American Males

TLAM2: 15/91/66/19

TLAM: 17/85/62/19

Ride Along: 14/88/63/28

Best Man Holiday: 13/75/57/16




African-American Females

TLAM2: 27/98/71/31

TLAM: 25/97/75/43

Ride Along: 19/83/78/40

Best Man Holiday: 24/86/80/34




General audience moviegoers are likely preoccupied with the two big openers this weekend, and as a result we see good movement in all measures except first choice. Moviegoers 17-34 today land at 8% unaided (+3), 66% total aware (+3), 40% definite interest (+3), and 6% first choice.




Jump Street and How to Train Your Dragon are both poised to have very good weekends, and Jersey Boys only registers with Caucasians age 45 and older. Among the newcomers to tracking, Deliver Us From Evil debuts with the highest awareness (more on that later this morning), and Tammy has a decent start among the general sample with 2% unaided, 46% aware, 43% definite interest, and 2% first choice (3/46/43/1 among African-Americans). Earth to Echo looks okay (1/43/30/2 among general, 1/47/32/3 among African-Americans), though their real strength would lie in family tracking. The bottom line is that it doesn’t seem like any of the debut films will steal much first choice, if any, from Think Like A Man Too before we open. 




We have 56% of our media left to run, and the whole campaign is going to ramp up over this final week. Tonight we are on game 4 of the NBA Finals, Kimmel’s NBA special, and Hell’s Kitchen. Tonight and over the weekend we will be on plenty of Sportscenter, Conan, @Midnight, the Finals game 5, American Dad, Family Guy, and more. We are also running tune-ins, stunts, vignettes, and interstitials on BET, Bounce, Bravo, E!, GSN, Comedy Central, Tru TV, OWN, and TV One. 




Kevin’s domain.com to Facebook was great, and we expect to push that content out via social and our YouTube channel shortly. Online we have close to half of our impressions still to land over this last stretch of the campaign. Our amazing cast continues to spread the word. Regina was on Craig Ferguson last night, while Kevin, Terrence, and LaLa hosted a screening in Atlanta, and Michael and Meagan hosted a screening in DC. Kevin, Terrence, and LaLa will do a press day in Atlanta today, then Kevin and Terrence are off to Chicago to host another screening tonight. Michael and Meagan will do DC press then move north to Philadelphia for a screening tonight. 




This weekend will belong to Jump Street and How to Train Your Dragon, but next weekend is all ours. We have an amazing closing week planned, and we’re right where we need to be.
