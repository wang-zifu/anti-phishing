Regarding the use of a copyrighted picture

Dear Mrs. Weil,

Greetings,

My name is Jonathan Bluestein. I am a martial arts teacher and author hailing from Israel. I am in the process of completing a large book project about martial arts, to be published worldwide in the near future, titled 'Research of Martial Arts'.

In my book I wish to include, as reference material, an image taken from the film 'The Karate Kid'  [1984] (see attached image), . It is my understanding that the above-mentioned film is owned by Columbia Pictures, and that Sony Pictures is the parent company. I therefore wish to ask if you would be willing to approve the usage of the picture in my book.

I am giving you my guarantee that usage of this image will not be in any way derogatory or offensive towards the film material, and will present it in a positive light.The image is to be one among many used in the book, and would not be used on either front or back covers. Neither would the book capitalize on the popularity of the film for its publicity.I am also willing to sign any document or request related to this copyright approval, wherein you may find some measure like this necessary. 

Your kindness and aid on the matter are very much appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Jonathan Bluestein.
