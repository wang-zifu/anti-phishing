         For Florida State Football Player, a Hit-and-Run Becomes Traffic Tickets




          In the early-morning hours of Oct. 5, as Tallahassee was celebrating another
big football victory by Florida State University, a starting cornerback on the
team drove his car into the path of an oncoming vehicle driven by a teenager
returning home from a job at the Olive Garden.
Both cars were totaled. But
rather than remain at the scene as the law requires, the football player, P. J.
Williams, left his wrecked vehicle in the street and fled into the darkness
along with his two passengers, including Ronald Darby, the team’s other
starting cornerback.

hit-and-run had never happened.
