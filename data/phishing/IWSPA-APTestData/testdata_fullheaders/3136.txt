Hi Jill -

It was good to see you all in DC.  I am afraid we won't be able to subscrib
e. It's just not something we have money for, but we are certainly happy to
 continue to share whatever polling we do with you all if that's helpful.  
We'd be happy to help you all with briefings in DC, but I imagine you'd wan
t to do that with subscirbers.  If not, let us know.  We'd be happy to do t
hat.

best,

Jennifer

Hi there, hope this finds you well.  I wanted to follow-up on our conversat
ion in Laguna at DA and the meeting Jen and I had in DC a few weeks later. 
 We are doing a great deal of state and national message research and polli
ng on a host of issues and demographics and need to start doing briefings n
ot only in states but in DC.  I'm wondering if you all have decided if you 
are going to subscribe to PNW to have access to all of our research and in 
hopes that we can co-host some of our national briefings.  We are doing a D
C briefing in late September on a very large national reframing reproductiv
e health and choices project we just completed with Benneson Strategy Group
 and it struck me that we never came to closure on our conversation as this
 may be a good joint opportunity.

Best, Jill
