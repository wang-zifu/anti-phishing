The Conservative Response to Our Health Care Crisis: 37 Bills, No Solutions

A new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund shows that
 in reality, the 37 bills that conservatives in the House of Representative
s point to as their alternatives for fixing our nation's broken health care
 system add up to very little, as far as actual solutions are concerned.

Please find a summary of the findings below. A chart examining each of the 
37 bills can be found here<<<link>>

The Conservative Response to Our Health Care Crisis: 37 Bills, No Solutions

October 8, 2015 

CAP Action's scrutiny of the 37 bills that Republicans waved at President B
arack Obama during his recent speech on health care reform to the joint ses
sion of the Congress show that Republicans are being disingenuous about bot
h the scope of these so-called solutions and the fact that they have not be
en considered by the Democratic leadership. These bills were put together b
y the Republican Study Committee under the title "Health Care Solutions by 
RSC Members."

Our analysis of these bills shows:

 *   There is a paucity of new ideas and solutions for health care reform i
n the Republican camp. Many of these bills echo only a few themes-medical l
iability and tax cuts, for example-and five of them are reworkings of McCai
n election proposals, which were rejected by the majority of American voter
s.
 *   A small number of smart ideas proposed by Republicans (eight) have bee
n incorporated into the House and Senate bills.
 *   Some of these bills (five) lie outside of the jurisdiction of committe
es that have reported bills, and since no bill has yet come to the House fl
oor there has been no opportunity for their consideration or inclusion in t
he reform legislation. In these cases, claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pe
losi and the Democratic majority have not considered these bills in committ
ee or on the House floor fails to recognize the procedural rules of the Hou
se.
 *   Only five amendments relating to these bills were offered during marku
p of the bills that do lie within the jurisdiction of the House committees 
that have reported out H.R. 3200. The obvious explanation is that Republica
ns don't really care whether these bills are enacted or not.
 *   In 18 cases there were opportunities for these legislative provisions 
to be included in other more appropriate legislative vehicles that have mov
ed through the House, and Republicans have not worked to make this happen.
 *   A number of these bills (five) have been around since the 106th Congre
ss-over a decade ago-so claiming that Speaker Pelosi is responsible for fai
lure to ensure their consideration ignores the fact that the House was cont
rolled by Republicans for the major part of that time.
 *   Nine bills were introduced after July 1, so it's unreasonable to expec
t their inclusion in legislative packages that were already being written a
t that time.
 *   Thirteen bills have no or only one cosponsor, so we assume they have l
ittle Republican support.

All in all it's a bit rich for Republicans to claim they have solutions and
 that these solutions have been ignored by the Democrats. It takes more tha
n a few sentences of legislative language on paper waved rudely at the pres
ident to tackle
