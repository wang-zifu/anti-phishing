At "women's event" Today, Sen. John McCain Caught Blatantly
Misrepresenting His Record on Equal Pay

JOHN MCCAIN: "We haven't done enough. We have not done enough. And I'm
committed to making sure that there's equal pay for equal work. That
there is equal opportunity in every aspect of our society. And that is
my record and you can count on it."

ions_ensign_porter_votes_against_fair_pay_act/>  holding Senator John
Ensign (R-NV) and Rep. Jon Porter (R-NV) accountable for voting against
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, long-overdue legislation that would
level the playing field for women and men who have been victims of pay
discrimination by allowing them to seek justice in the courts - today
called U.S. Senator John McCain to the carpet today for blatantly
misrepresenting his record on equal pay during his campaign sponsored
"women's event."   *The record speaks for itself below.

            "It's amazing see Senator 'Straight Talk Express' McCain
with a straight face talk about his commitment to and his record
fighting for equal pay after very publicly decrying the Lilly Ledbetter
Fair Pay Act and after telling a 14 year old girl that Equal
Rights/Equal Pay wouldn't "do anything to help the rights of women,"
said Lauren Weiner of Americans United for Change. "That's not straight
talk - that's disingenuous and disrespectful political pandering and he
should be ashamed."

John McCain's Disappointing Record on Equal Pay

 McCain Missed Vote To Provide Equal Pay To Women. On April 23, McCain
skipped a vote to invoke cloture on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,
which would "amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to allow employees to file
charges of pay discrimination within 180 days of the last received
paycheck affected by the alleged discriminatory decision."  [HR 2831,
Vote #110

McCain Said He Opposed Equal Pay Bill.  The Associated Press ran the
following headline: "McCain opposes equal pay bill backed by rivals."
The AP reported, "Republican Sen. John McCain, campaigning through
poverty-stricken cities and towns, said Wednesday he opposes a Senate
bill that seeks equal pay for women because it would lead to more
lawsuits." [Associated Press, 4/24/08]

 McCain Said He Didn't Believe Equal Pay Bill Would "Do Anything To Help
The Rights Of Women."  During a McCain campaign event, McCain was asked
by a 14 year old girl about his opposition to equal pay laws. McCain
said, "I don't believe that this would do anything to help the rights of
women, except maybe help trial lawyers and others in that profession."
[Washington Post, The Trail Blog, 5/7/08

 McCain Acknowledged Pay Disparity, Said It Was Due To "Education and
Training" Differences. According to the Associated Press, McCain stated
his opposition to the bill as he campaigned in rural eastern Kentucky,
where poverty is worse among women than men. The Arizona senator said he
was familiar with the disparity but that there are better ways to help
women find better paying jobs. 'They need the education and training,
particularly since more and more women are heads of their households, as
much or more than anybody else,' McCain said. 'And it's hard for them to
leave their families when they don't have somebody to take care of
them.'" [Associated Press, 4/23/08

 McCain Voted Against Providing More Effective Remedies For Victims Of
Wage Discrimination. In 2000, McCain voted to impose a Budget Act point
of order tabling a Harkin amendment to "provide more effective remedies
to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of
sex." [S.Amdt. 3847 to H.R. 4810, Vote #203
<<<link>>
m.cfm?congress=3D106&session=3D2&vote=3D00203> , 7/17/00]

McCain Voted Against Federal Equal Pay Study. In 1985, John McCain voted
against passage of the bill to establish a commission to oversee a study
of the federal workforce to determine whether differences in pay and
classification have arisen because of discrimination on the basis of
sex, race or national origin." [1985 CQ Almanac; HR 3008, vote # 318,
10/9/85]

McCain Voted Against Rule For Federal Equal Pay Study. In 1985, John
McCain voted against the rule to allow "House floor consideration of the
bill to authorize an independent study to determine if pay differences
in the federal government are due to discrimination on the basis of sex,
race or Hispanic origin." [1985 CQ Almanac; HR 3008, vote # 263, 8/1/85]

JOHN MCCAIN: Now, ma'am, I don't know who printed your shirt but here's
the microphone and you can explain, have the view that you have and I'd
be glad to respond to a question.

QUESTIONER: Thank you. I was wondering, Senator McCain, why, um, when
you had the opportunity to vote to give equal rights to women, equal
pay, I was wondering why you didn't show up to vote and you said that if
you did, you wouldn't support it?

JOHN MCCAIN: I think you're referring to a vote recently that would've
allowed, which would've eliminated the statute of limitations on
lawsuits of, for charges or allegations of discrimination. Uh, I think
that if you eliminate the statute of limitations and make it, uh,
unending then you may be violating the rights of the individual who's
being sued as well, whether they be a man or a woman. So, I believe that
the Supreme Court's decision was correct, that there is a statute of
limitations as, as to when charges or allegations or legal means are
taken, uh, and I believe that it was a correct decision of the United
States Supreme Court and I don't believe that this would do anything to
help the rights of women except maybe help trial lawyers and others in
that profession. And that's my view. [applause]. If you'd like to follow
up, I'd be glad to hear your response to that. If you'd-obviously we
disagree but if you'd-would you-wou--would you like to make another
comment?

QUESTIONER: I have someone here who I think would like to-who I think
would be very more much articulate than me with answering th-

QUESTIONER 2: [to scattered booing] That's ok, she's fourteen years old,
ok?
