Antonella,
my fault.

The flight we need should be provided from Star Alliance group (maybe not
Lufthansa).

Thank you,
Alessandro

Subject: Flight Reservation Request: from Vancouver to New York City

Ciao Antonella,
I just got confirmation by Alex that we can directly travel to NYC from
Vancouver (the meeting in Washington DC has NOT been confirmed).

So please, can you arrange reservation for me and Alex with flight from
Vancouver to NYC on Thursday morning, July 11?
Lufthansa should provide a direct flight (like from Mexico City to
Vancouver).

Thank you,
Alessandro
