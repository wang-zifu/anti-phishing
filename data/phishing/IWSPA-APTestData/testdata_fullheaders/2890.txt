On Saturday, September 6, Liberty Hill is going to put the “social” in “social justice” once again with music, a signature cocktail and the snappiest program you’ll ever experience at an afternoon event! Join us for Change LA. More than a simple social gathering, it’s a party with a purpose where hundreds of LA’s social justice advocates gather to spotlight the leadership of an emerging generation of young activists.

Change LA 2015 will take place September 6 from 3-5 pm at the Next Door Lounge in Hollywood. Buy your ticket now before it sells out!

Zoë Lloyd Foxley will receive the 2015 Sarah Pillsbury NextGen Award, which honors the domain.com of giving and commitment demonstrated by a young philanthropic leader. This award is named for one of Liberty Hill’s founders, the amazing Sarah Pillsbury, who created Liberty Hill back in 1976.

Please join Sarah, Zoë and Alexandra in uniting across the generations to create “Chan
