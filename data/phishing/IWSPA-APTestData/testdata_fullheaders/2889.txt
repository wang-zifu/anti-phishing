Dear Professor,

As you may recall from the message you received from Amy Garrison in Studen
t Affairs the University is in the process of upgrading the Event Managemen
t System.  The migration is slated to occur this weekend.   That migration 
requires that we rebuild the Law Center master calendar on the Law Center w
ebsite over this weekend as well.

Because the calendar serves as a repository for links to the faculty worksh
ops papers, Jennifer has created a table of those past links in case you ne
ed access to them (attached).  You may also wish to retain this information
, because when the calendar is rebuilt, the workshop data will only go back
 until the start of this semester.

We also wanted to let you know that you may see signs indicating that the c
alendar is under construction if you domain.com the site this weekend.

If you need information about an event while this work is being done, pleas
e contact Katherine McCarthy at user@domain.com<mailto:mccarthk
@law.georgetown.edu>.

We apologize for any inconvenience this causes you.  And we are working on 
a system to ensure that workshop archives will remain intact going forward.

Sincerely,

Monica

To Law Center Community:

The University is in the process of upgrading the Event Management System (
EMS), the room/space reservation system we use at the Law Center. The first
 phase of the project is nearing release to the University. Due to the comp
lexity of this project, there will be several phases.
In Phase 1 University Information Systems will integrate several Event Mana
gement Systems (main campus, Med School, and the Law Center) into a single 
instance of EMS. Additional phases will include incorporating additional gr
oups and activities into the system (more information to come).
The launch of Phase 1 is set for October 14, 2014. To allow for a smooth tr
ansition from the old systems to the integrated system, the Law Center Offi
ce of Student Life will stop confirming reservations using the current Virt
ual EMS system on Friday October 3, 2015 at 6:00 PM.  Now is the time to re
quest space needed for programs or meetings between the dates of October 4 
=96 14, 2014. Please utilize Virtual EMS to domain.com those Space Requests by 
5:30 PM on October 1, 2014.

Urgent requests that are for a program or meeting during Oct. 4 - 14 that a
rise after the October 1 request deadline must be submitted via by emailing
 or faxing the appropriate form<<<link>>
tudent-life/room-reservations/index.cfm> to the Office of Student Life, stu
user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>  202-662
-9261.
Requests for future events, those scheduled to happen after October 14, 201
4, will not be accepted or processed until the new system is functional fol
lowing the October 14, 2015 launch.  A notification will go out to the Law 
Center community once the Virtual EMS system is again live.  As we proceed,
 additional information and updates will be communicated.  If you have ques
tions, please contact Beverly Sapp<mailto:user@domain.com> in the 
Office of Student Life at 202-662-9661.

Important Dates:
Wednesday, October 1, 5:30 PM: Final day to domain.com space requests on Virtua
l EMS for programs/meetings before October 14, 2014.  No event requests con
sidered for events after October 14, 2014.
Friday, October 3, 2014: Final room confirmations sent from OSL to those re
questing space in Virtual EMS by Oct. 1 for programs before Oct. 14.
Friday, October 3 =96 Monday, October 13: Law Center Virtual EMS offline.  
Urgent requests during this time frame must be submitted using the appropri
ate form<<<link>>
ations/index.cfm> to OSL by email or fax.  Confirmations will be emailed.
Tuesday, October 14, 2014: NEW Virtual EMS site goes live.  More informatio
