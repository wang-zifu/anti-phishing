Highlight #1
*McCain is "Aggressive," More of a Neocon than Bush, "More Confrontational"
than Bush *(MSNBC 06/26/08 7:39am)
RICHARD C. HOLBROOKE: We've just seen a step forward in North Korea. We have
a presidential campaign in which this is a big, big difference between the
two candidates.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: you are exactly right, I mean John McCain's position is
even tougher than, I don't know if you'd say more conservative but it's more
of a neocon approach than even George W. Bush's . . .

HOLBROOKE: You just made a very important point for the voters . . . I've
been taking the McCain positions and the Obama positions and looking at them
and what's really interesting is that McCain, on issue after issue, McCain
is taking positions tougher than Bush, there's kind of an aggressive. He
knows his issues but=97on Russia, he wants to kick Russia out of the G8. You
can't do that. On Iran he says the only thing worse than war with Iran is a
nuclear Iran. On Iraq we know his positions. He is taking very, very hard
line positions.

SCARBOROUGH: Let's underline this point right now . . . John McCain's
positions are even further, let's say more confrontational than Bush's.
There is a greater distance between Obama and McCain than Obama and Bush.

Highlight #2
*Romney Talks McCain and Partisanship, State of Republican Party* (CNN,
06/25/08, 7:24am)
JOHN ROBERTS: John McCain is launching a new line of attack this morning,
his campaign released a memo just a couple of hours ago saying, Barack Obama
has consistently put his party and his own self interests ahead of the
nation. This comes after Karl Rove said that the democratic candidate was
quote "arrogant".

[=85]

MITT ROMNEY: [=85] The fact, and reality is that he's not a very experienced
person. He's not someone who has shown, if you will, the kind of leadership
that I think America needs right now in such a critical time. He has
consistently voted with his party on the most partisan issues and put his
party's and his personal interests ahead of those of the nation. And I think
been unable during his career, at any time, to reach across the aisle, find
compromise, find ways to get things done, other than simply toeing the party
line. I think people feel we've had too much of that in Washington and
that's in part why I think John McCain will be successful. His reputation
and record is as a leader, who reaches across the line, sometimes, you know,
he's thumbed his nose at his own party and said, look you guys are wrong. He
does what he thinks is right.

[=85]

ROMNEY: John, there's no question there are a number of republicans, and
that's John McCain included, who are willing to reach across the aisle and
work with democrats. [=85]

ROBERTS: You know, there's an interesting column that Robert Novak has got
out there today. He's talking about this group of people called the
Obama-cons, conservatives who may support Barack Obama. And he suggests that
Senator John McCain is at risk of losing some conservative votes, not
necessarily because they agree with Senator Obama's positions, but because
they do not like the Bush administration and they are looking for something
different. And he quotes a conservative, Larry Hunter, who says quote, "The
Republican party is a dead rotting carcass with a few domain.com old leaders
stumbling around like zombies in a  horror version of weekend with Bernie,
handcuffed to a corpse." Do you agree with any of that? Is that what the
Republican party is these days?

ROMNEY: Gee, I don't think so. You know you're going to find some
discontents in any party. And are there things that our party could do
better? Absolutely. And are there opportunities for new ideas and strong
leadership? Absolutely. And I think John McCain represents that. At the same
time, I think you're finding in our party that people are rallying strongly
around Senator McCain. I've had the chance to speak now at convention in
Maine, Nevada, and frankly all over the country, Texas. And people are
enthusiastic about Senator McCain, in party because they recognize how
critical the times are right now and how wrong Barack Obama is. Look, he's a
very nice fellow, but on the issues of the day he's just simply wrong. [=85]

*Romney Talks McCain on Korea and Oil Drilling/Energy *(FNC, 06/25/08,
7:57am)
 [=85]

BRIAN KILMEADE: Governor, when you talk about six party talks, there's a lot
of people who think that we should not have been in them, there's a lot of
democrats in particular that say, let's just go and talk to our enemies.
Does John McCain subscribe to the six party talks? I know you're also a
worker, trying to get John McCain in that White House.

MITT ROMNEY: Well, Senator McCain recognizes that in order for us to make
progress in negotiations diplomatically with other nations, we have to
strength at our side. That when you bargain with a position of strength,
that when you have leverage, you're able to get more done. When you're
dealing with a nation like Iran for instance, that it's critical to have
Europe combined with us, in putting in place the kind of sanctions to get
Iran to move. And the same is true in regards to North Korea. You have to
have our friends around the world, and even some of those, if you will, are
partners with the same interests, come in together and put in pressure on a
regime like Kim Jong Il's regime. The idea of just showing up and saying,
hey let's talk, no preconditions, no pressure, no leverage, that's something
that accomplished virtually nothing. I think history has shown that where
that was done, America's interests were not advanced.

CLAYTON MORRIS: Governor, you just mentioned leverage, the President
mentioning leverage in asking how it was actually working in North Korea and
he said you had to do it with leverage. John McCain in an interview about a
week ago said, he didn't think the United States had sufficient leverage.
Where's the disconnect there between John McCain and the Bush White House?

ROMNEY: Well, actually I don't think it's a disconnect. The President
indicated that the United States alone doesn't have the kind of leverage on
a nation like North Korea that the United States has if we're combined with
Russia, and South Korea, and China, and Japan. And particularly China,
2/3rds of the trade that goes on in North Korea goes on with China. And so
when China sits at the table, which they did last Fall. Which they're saying
you know, we're going to pull back on our shipments of gasoline into North
Korea. That's a message that's heard loud and clear by Kim Jong Il.

GRETCHEN CARLSON: Governor, I want to ask you a quick question, this of
course was breaking news this morning, but I do want to ask you about the
gas situation in the United States. Because, it's interesting to watch our
political season this year, who would have known that this would become the
hot topic now. You would like to point out that you feel that John McCain
and Senator Barack Obama have very differing plans when it comes to how to
control high gas prices.

ROMNEY: Well, there's no question about that. Barack Obama I think, pretty
consistently through his career has proven that he puts the partisan
interests of the left-wing of the Democratic party first. And with regards
to energy, that means he has to be, and he is, anti-nuclear power. He stands
in favor of putting a new tax on coal and natural gas, those are of course
the two big domestic sources of energy that we have to tap into. He's
against offshore drilling, ANWR drilling, and so forth. John McCain, on the
other hand , is saying look, we got to get ourselves off of our dependence
on foreign sources of energy. And so John McCain is saying, look, let's
explore drilling offshore, let's think again about ANWR. Let's certainly
fast-track nuclear power plants. Everybody agrees we ought to have all of
the renewable sources of energy that we can. Solar, wind power,
agriculturally based sources of energy. We all agree on that. But we also
need those additional sources, which John McCain supports and of course,
Barack Obama, unwilling to part with the partisan part of his party. He's
unwilling to take those steps.

*Romney on Energy and Green Technology *(MSNBC 06/26/08 8:03am)
JOE SCARBOROUGH:  . . . you're a Michigan guy. Tell me, why can't Americans
make a car like Toyota that gets fifty miles to the gallon?

MITT ROMNEY: It's one of the great imponderables . . . we have been so far
behind on the technology front . . . and I'd like to see us as a nation
invest dramatically more in terms of energy efficiency. That's something I
think you're going to see coming out of a McCain White House . . .
investments in technology to help us become energy independent.

[. . .]

ROMNEY: We haven't had an energy policy. We haven't been investing in
technology to find new sources of energy . . . we got to be far more
committed to spending the research dollars it takes to find new sources of
energy . . . we can do that and that's why I'm convinced that John McCain's
right. We need more drilling, more nuclear power, clean burning coal, you
need all of the sources that really have great promise for us to finally get
us energy indepndent.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: But doesn't he need to demand it? . . . at this point I
think that the criticism has been that there hasn't been real leadership on
this issue? . . . what does John McCain need to do to really draw the line
on this?

[. . .]

ROMNEY: Well, I think you're going to see over the course of this campaign
that people are going to listen to both candidates and people are going to
make their assessment as to what they really think about the candidates when
they've heard from them. And this is a little early and I think with time .
=2E . people are going to recognize the Barack Obama consistently puts the
partisan interests of his party and his own personal interests . . . ahead
of the country.

Highlight #3
*Shrum: McCain has the Style of Dole and the Substance of Bush *(MSNBC
06/26/08 7:12am)
BOB SHRUM: And I'm not sure so far that John McCain has shown he's a much
better candidate than President Ford was.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Really?

SHRUM: Right now, John McCain, who I said was the strongest Republican
nominee . . . is coming across as a combination, stylistically, of Bob Dole,
and, substanitvaly, of George Bush.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: That's how I see.

SCARBOROUGH: What's happened to him?

SHRUM: . . . they had three or four months where they had the nomination
consolidated and they didn't seem to do anything with it. They didn't seem
to come up with a long-term game plan. They didn't seem to come up with a
big positive argument about how he does represent change. Maybe he is just
so determined to spend his time talking about the Iraq War, talking about
international policy, not really addressing the economy and placating the
Republican base that he's never going to do it.

SCARBOROUGH: But as long as the news is good out of Iraq, which it has been,
at least over the last couple weeks . . . Americans don't care about Iraq,
they don't want to hear about Iraq. . .

Highlight #4
*Pfotenhauer Talks McCain and Oil and Energy *(FNC, 06/25/08, 8:51am)
BRIAN KILMEADE: First off, Nancy, you're getting a lot of grief foe,
according to Barack Obama, Senator McCain's getting some grief because he
used the term "psychological effect" when it comes to drilling at home, not
a financial effect.

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: Well that just reveals ignorance of the future markets. I
mean on the one hand, people complain about speculators, on the other hand
Obama wants to dismiss the role that they play on oil prices. So, when we
announce that we are no longer going to be relying on foreign sources for
our oil , and that we're going to take our destiny into our own hands, if
you will, by increasing domestic production. That sends an immediate signal
to the market, and the market reacts very very quickly. Also, Obama people,
and Obama himself would like you to believe that it's going to be about a
decade before we actually see oil out of the ground. They exaggerate that by
about twice as long as what we've heard it to be. So about 5 years until we
see that oil actually come online, but an immediate short term effect on
prices is absolutely possible.

*Pfotenhauer Talks McCain and Oil and Energy Cont.* (FNC, 6/25/08, 9:03am)
GRETCHEN CARLSON: McCain yesterday did say that he's setting a goal of
weaning the U.S. off of foreign oil by 2025. Sounds like a long way off, but
it's really not, right?

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: It's not, you know, and if I can just say that this is
really emblematic of Senator McCain. He's the type of person who has always
put his country first and has been willing to take on controversial issues
when they were essential to ensuring our prosperity and our peace. And this
is very emblematic of him. I have to say, I think it is also emblematic of
Senator Obama's unwillingness to ever break with his party leadership, to do
something that is difficult but in our country's interest. And you see, he
has no short term policy solutions, because he would alienate the left, the
hard left part of his base.

BRIAN KILMEADE: Will you confirm some reports that say that the Senator is
revisiting ANWR and might consider supporting drilling there?

PFOTENHAUER: I can't confirm that, I certainly have not heard anything along
those lines.

Highlight #5
*Religion and Politics Examined, McCain's Pastor Problems Highlighted* (ABC,
06/25/08, 7:16am)
DAN ABRAMS: So why is religion playing such a combustible role in this
election? In part, some observers say, because we have an unusual situation
where the democrat seems more comfortable talking about his faith than the
republican. Obama is trying to turn that to his advantage by aggressively
courting evangelicals.

[=85]

ABRAMS: It's worth noting that John McCain has had pastor problems too.
Choosing to renounce endorsements from John Hagee and Rob Parsley after
their controversial comments came to light.

ROD PARSLEY: Islam is an anti-Christ religion.

ABRAMS: At this point John McCain has a solid lead among evangelical voters,
but some observers believe that Obama may have a real shot at peeling off
some moderates. Which is why you can expect Obama to keep emphasizing his
faith, despite Robin, what we've seen to be the obvious risks of this
strategy.

Highlight #6
*McCain is Computer Illiterate, Importance of President and domain.com
Examined* (CNN, 06/25/08, 6:55am)
JOHN ROBERTS: It turns out that the man who could be our next president is
far from computer savvy.

[=85]

JEANE MOOS: We don't expect the president to be the Liberace of the
keyboard. But still, should the next President of the United States know how
to work a computer?

CHILD: I mean, yeah, I guess so, it would be helpful. Why not?

MOOS: Ask John McCain. Here's how he describes his computer skills.

JOHN MCCAIN: I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the
assistance that I can get.

ANNONYMOUS: Oh that's absolutely ridiculous. It's the 21st Century and you
should know how to do it. He's got people to do that! He's got to be
thinking of more important things.

MOOS: While Cindy McCain's been spotted scrolling her blackberry. John
McCain tends to be handed a blackberry to talk on. Barack Obama on the other
hand is one of those guys so intent on reading his blackberry that he could
run into something. He is a blackberry fiend, says his spokesperson, has a
laptop on the road and sometimes uses it to talk to his daughters, and surfs
the web when he is in need of important information such as sports scores. A
far cry from this guy [Bush]

GEORGE BUSH: I hear there's rumors on the internets. And on of the things
I've used
on the Google is [=85]

MOOS: Just the other day President Bush did it again.

BUSH: They can go on their computers and dial up domain.com.

MOOS: At least John McCain isn't still dialing up, he knows to leave off the
"the". But
McCain's admission that he was computer illiterate was fodder for debate at
something called the Personal Democracy Forum. The online expert who had
worked for John Edwards got into it with the domain.com expert for the McCain
campaign. [=85] But when McCain's guy said this, "John McCain is aware of th
e
domain.com" became a joke on the domain.com. But do we really want a president
that sits around the oval office googling all day? This 74 year old likes to
Google.

74 YEAR OLD WOMAN: I mean this is such an easy thing to learn, I taught
myself how to use the computer.

MOOS: At least John McCain knows the difference between a laptop and a lap
dance. Even if jokers made a mockup of McCain's real website with "How does
this thing work?" and "Should I double click here?"

Local Highlight #1
STEVE WOLFORD: Along with supporters, there were also a number of protestors
at UNLV for McCain's domain.com. A group of disabled veterans asked McCain to
"walk the walk" by supporting the troops and green energy to create jobs in
Nevada.
