McCain Promises To Help Ohio Residents Who Lost Their Jobs Because Of
His Campaign Manager <<<link>>>

Today, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is in Wilmington, OH and being forced to
address DHL's merger with Airborne-Express, which may cost roughly 8,000
jobs <<<link>>>  in the
area. In a private meeting, "residents will ask McCain for help in
stopping DHL's proposal
<<<link>>
30135640.xml&coll=3D2>  to domain.com using the airport as a hub," which would
put the air park out of business.

In a townhall on July 9, a resident asked McCain what he would do to
mitigate the merger's effects on the area. "I want to be able to keep
our nonprofits alive," she said, crying. McCain said the impact of the
merger on area jobs is a "terrible blow":

	MCCAIN:This is a terrible blow. Um, if there's an anti-trust
implication that's associated with this, I certainly would seek a
thorough investigation ... I've got to look you in the eye and give you
some straight talk; I don't know if I can stop it or not. Or if it will
be stopped it. ... In fact, some more straight talk: I doubt it. Ok?

"In the meantime, there are manufacturing jobs that have been lost all
over the state of Ohio, and it's been a terrible trauma," he said. Watch
it:

Today, McCain is dealing with the fallout from the merger. But five
years ago, McCain's campaign manager lobbied heavily
<<<link>>>  for the
deal. The AP reports that Davis "lobbied the Senate to accept the
proposal by DHL
<<<link>>>  to buy
Airborne Express for $1.05 billion." Davis's lobbying firm reaped the
benefits:

Filings in the Senate show Davis' lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, was
hired to help both companies deal with Congress, where objections over
DHL's foreign ownership arose. Davis and a partner earned their firm
$185,000 for the DHL-Airborne Express work that year, records show.

"McCain took steps that helped Davis's clients
<<<link>>
62502858_pf.html> " and thwarted Sen. Ted Stevens's (R-AK) "effort to
insert language into legislation that would domain.com foreign-controlled
companies such as DHL from holding certain military contracts," the
Washington Post reported in June.

Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) called the situation "one of the worst job
catastrophes
<<<link>>>  that any
community in this nation is facing." Will McCain deliver straight talk
about the role that he and his campaign manager
<<<link>>>  had in helping shuttle through
the DHL deal?
