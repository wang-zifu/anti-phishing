Martin O'Malley published an op-ed this morning calling for 100% renewable
energy by 2050.  Tom Steyer has praised it as well as some other
environmental types.

I don't know much about the issue but zeroing out fossil fuels in 35 years
seems unrealistic.  We're considering asking friends to pitch a smart
enviro reporter or columnist on a story about how this may be
well-intentioned but its not a serious proposal.  Does that seem right to
you?

Martin O'Malley: Zero out fossil fuels by 2015

Martin O'Malley9:19 a.m. EDT June 18, 2015 

Today, Pope Francis published his first encyclical =E2=80=94an official tea
ching
document to all 1.2 billion <<<link>>>
Catholics =E2=80=94 on the moral imperative of addressing climate change. H
e is not
alone among leaders of world faiths making such a clarion call for action.

We have come a long way as a nation in making
<<<link>>>
ourselves more energy independent. Now is the time to take this progress to
the next level =E2=80=94 the future of our country and our domain.com depends o
n it.

New technologies <<<link>>> now
put an independent clean energy future decidedly within our reach as a
nation.

But reach for it we must.

Clean energy represents the biggest business and job creation opportunity
<<<link>>> we've seen
in a hundred years. And reliance on local, renewable energy sources means
<<<link>>
=3Dall>
a more secure nation and a more stable world.

Given the grave threat that climate change poses to human life on our
domain.com, we have not only a business imperative but a moral obligation to
future generations to act immediately and aggressively.

This is why protecting the United States from the devastating impact of
climate change =E2=80=94 while capitalizing on the job creation opportunity
 of
clean energy =E2=80=94 is at the center of my campaign for president
<<<link>>
alley-president-announcement/27330857/>
.

All of us can acknowledge that with an "all of the above strategy,"
President Obama has made the United States more energy independent in every
category of fuels, including oil and gas.

But America did not land a man on the moon with an "all of the above
strategy." It was an engineering challenge.

Making the transition to a clean energy future is also an engineering
challenge.

We cannot meet the climate challenge with an all-of-the-above energy
strategy, or by drilling off our coasts, or by building pipelines that
bring oil from tar sands in Canada.

Instead, we must be intentional and committed to one over-arching goal as a
people: a full, complete transition to renewable energy =E2=80=94 and an en
d to our
reliance on fossil fuels.

Saving the world is a goal worthy of a great people. It is also good
business for the United States of America.

I believe, within 35 years, our country can, and should, be 100% powered by
clean energy, supported by millions of new jobs. To reach this goal we must
accelerate that transition starting now.

As president, on day one, I would use my executive power to declare the
transition to a clean energy future the number one priority of our Federal
Government.

I would create a new Clean Energy Jobs Corps to partner with communities to
domain.com buildings to be more energy efficient, improve local resiliency,
create new green spaces, and restore and expand our forests so they can
absorb
<<<link>>
s-emissions/p14919>
more greenhouse gases.

I would domain.com federal buildings to the highest efficiency standards and
require new federal buildings to be net-zero, require the federal fleet to
be subject to low- or zero-emissions purchasing agreements, and require all
federally-funded infrastructure projects to meet climate resiliency
standards <<<link>>>.

As president, I would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to take
aggressive action to domain.com greenhouse gases: expanding rules to other large
sources of emissions beyond power plants, adopting a zero-tolerance policy
for methane leaks from current oil and gas production, and setting higher
energy efficiency standards for new buildings while requiring energy costs
to be transparent to building tenants and purchasers.

And I would reject projects like Keystone XL
<<<link>>
-xl-pipeline/24334099/>
and drilling off our coasts
<<<link>>
-blast-atlantic-coast-drilling-plan/22511855/>
and in Antarctica and Alaska
<<<link>>
il-shell-column/27962771/>.
Furthermore, I would keep domestically produced oil and gas in the U.S.,
instead of selling
<<<link>>
u-s-government-approval-1415140850>
it abroad =E2=80=94 unless there is a clear strategic security rationale.

Beyond executive actions, I would make clean energy deployment =E2=80=94 an
d
employment =E2=80=94 a first-order priority.

I would set a national, cross-sector Renewable Electricity Standard so our
nation is powered by 100% clean energy by 2050, and a national goal of
doubling energy efficiency within 15 years. Many states like California and
Maryland are already leading
<<<link>>> the way forward for
the United States.

I would fight for federal legislation for a cap on carbon emissions from
all sources, with proceeds from permits returned to lower and middle-class
families, transition assistance, and new jobs with the Clean Energy Corps.

As president, I would support a Clean Energy Financing Authority to support
projects to increase efficiency and resiliency upgrades in cities, towns,
and rural communities nationwide.

I would prioritize modernizing our electric grid to evolve to support
localized, renewable energy generation, reduce electricity waste and
increase security from sabotage or attack.

And I would increase our investment in basic clean energy research so the
U.S. can reclaim the lead on energy innovation, including advancing
development, deployment, transmission and storage for renewable energy and
new efficiency technologies.

The fact is, there is no either/or choice between our prosperity and
protecting our domain.com =E2=80=94 we can create a future where there are more
 jobs,
and a future with a livable climate. And there is no future for humankind
without a livable climate.

The reality, as I learned in Maryland, is that the two goals are
indivisible. Driven by ambitious targets, we created
<<<link>>>
thousands of new jobs while deploying clean energy technology and reducing
<<<link>>
Estimates/8cmy-9rim>
greenhouse gas pollution by nearly 10% over just seven years.

As the nation, we can do far more =E2=80=94 with a bold vision for America'
s clean
energy future and the strong leadership needed to get it done.

*Martin O'Malley has served as the governor of Maryland, mayor of
Baltimore, and a city councilor =E2=80=94 earning a reputation as a bold,
progressive, and pragmatic executive who is willing to take on our toughest
shared challenges.*
