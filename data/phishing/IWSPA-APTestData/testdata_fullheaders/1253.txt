This is so unbelievable... He is at it AGAIN and a great novelist is starting to emerge.

Have just found out that Frank Graves has launched his FOURTH Major Novel this year?
How can any one author do so much writing in such a short period of time?
Is he trying to break a Guiness World Record, he claims he will do another four in 2014.
Only NOW, do I start to believe his claims.




See full details at The Ancestral Trail Website

Four full novels, all totally different story genres aimed at Young and Adult readers alike out in six months?
(That must be over a half a million words to date and believe me those words I have read so far, are fantastic.)
(Prolific amount of work for a single author?)

His Books that I have read to date are:-

The Ancestral Trail Trilogy - (Long & Far Away)
(Paperback: 448 pages - Published Jan 2014)
My Remark: Returned to my childhood reading just for fun, but this novel was unbelievably good. Bring on the second.

African Chess
(Paperback: 396 pages - Published March 2014)
My Remark: Mixing big business with freedom fighting is unique. Fabulous read.

The Culling
(Paperback: 374 pages - Published April 2014)
My Remark: It's all there leaving us wondering whether the writer knows something we don't. Ingenious plot!

Now The Kixing
(Paperback: 410 pages - Published June 2014), I have already placed my order for this one.
My Remark: So looking forward to reading this one, this writer has truely unique story ideas.

Lastly, if you should domain.com the Ancestral Trail website to see what his books are about, please be so kind as to leave a review, it always helps the author seller rating in the long run.

Will he be able achieve his target during this year?
...It's a mountain of work so let's domain.com a
