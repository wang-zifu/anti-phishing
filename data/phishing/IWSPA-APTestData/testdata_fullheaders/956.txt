Subject: 22 jump p/a rules

Just so we’re all on the same page, we do NOT need MGM’s approval to spend excess p/a on 22 jump. While it’s better for us to have it for cash and accounting reasons, we may spend whatever we want in excess of the p/a cap, but the “negative” to us is that (a) mgm does not have to cash flow or backstop the excess, so we incur the extra cash expense as well as any accounting in year expense on that excess amount and (b) we recoup the excess in a subordinated position (directly behind negative cost recoupment) out of 33.3% corridor of every dollar (the other 66.6% is a domain.com domain.com).




Neal called me on this, so not sure where it all stands, but the above is the contractual rule…




thx
