Hello all!

I want to first thank you for your great service to our nation with helping
to elect Hillary Clinton as our next President of the United States! I
apologize for all of the emails I send to you (the senior staff), I am just
extremely passionate about getting Hillary elected and helping out in any
way that I can. As you know, the Michigan Primary is approaching us very
quickly, and I would love your help in making sure the State of Michigan
becomes pro-Hillary!

As some of you know, I am the President and Campaign Manager of Spartans
for Hillary at Michigan State University (which has over 50,000 students).
Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could get all of those students out to vote
for Hillary and eliminate the notion that she doesn't connect with young
people?

That being said, would one of you be interested in coming in and speaking
to our General Assembly about what you do on the campaign, how important it
is that we win this election so that Hillary can fight for us, and, most
importantly, tell a personal story about why you support Hillary?

We hope to have you come in before the primary (that way the polls will be
in our favor when people go to vote on March 8th)! We meet every Tuesday
from 6-7:30pm in 334A Case Hall, and if you could just speak for 20-30
minutes (this includes questions), we could dedicate the rest of the time
to phone-banking! If those dates do not work for any of you, we can
certainly reschedule our GA meeting.

Also, if HRC is interested in coming to speak to campus (perhaps before she
goes to debate in Flint, MI) we can certainly work on that, as well!
Imagine Hillary speaking to a large crowd of young people, with the energy
high, and students chanting "I'm with her!" The press would *love *it!
President Obama talked to MSU's campus when running for office, and it
certainly helped him in the polls. If HRC cannot make it before the
primary, we would love to have her before the general!

If you are interested in one, or both, of my propositions, please reach out
by replying to this email or calling me at (989) 992-3395. I'd be happy to
speak any day of the week and at any time. I look forward to your
correspondence!

All best,

Ronald E. Owens III
