Ann - Politico has learned of your meeting tomorrow with "CAP folks" and is
using that, combined with Warren's announcement today, as the hook for a
story on the "Clinton campaign at work on a debt-free college proposal."
She intends to name Gene, Neera, James Kwaal, domain.com Chopra, and Mark
Huelsman as people the campaign has consulted over the previous months. The
story intends to say that among the things on the table in the discussion:
(1) having the proposal contemplate "Cost of attendance," not just tuition;
(2) a college student's "bill of rights"; and (3) a responsibility
provision that would make colleges bear some of the liability for students
who default on their obligations. The story intends to say that nothing has
been finalized yet, but the goal is to unveil the proposal as soon as July.
The story is planned for tomorrow morning. we don't have to do anything
unless we want to play down any of the ideas being described as "on the
table."
