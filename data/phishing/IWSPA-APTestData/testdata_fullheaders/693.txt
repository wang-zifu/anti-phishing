Hi team, you should have received an invite for meetings on Thursdays at 4pm. This is a standing weekly meeting for regionals (Walker, Walter, TJ, Deshundra, and Shu-Yen). And every other week, the entire press team will join. So  keep that time frame open on your calendars accordingly.

This week will just be the regionals instead of the whole team since we all met yesterday.

Rachel
