It seems here that AVG toolbar (and nothing more) prevent the upgrade of the agent.
I'm attaching a patch that let you upgrade the agent.

1) Copy this file to the RCS DB machine
2) Extract in any folder (the content is a file named patch.rb)
3) Open cmd.exe move to that folder and run "ruby patch.rb"
3) You will see a message like "avg removed from the blacklist"
4) Proceed with the upgrade of that agent
5) Once you have upgraded it (be sure of that) re-execute the command at step 3 and you'll see the message "avg added to blacklist"

Thanks, best regards
