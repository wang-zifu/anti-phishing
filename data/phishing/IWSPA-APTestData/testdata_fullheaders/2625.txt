Trump on Hannity

Part 1

Is it sinking in?
- Very close
- Most votes in GOP history

SCOTUS List. Judicial philosophy?
- Got a lot of feedback from a lot of people
- Will choose people from the list, or people that are very close
- Federalist Society was involved, Sessions
- Trump reads the list of names
- Compliments Mike Lee in noting he is Thomas Lee's brother
- Says he is a Constitutionalist
- Wanted to put list out to quell fears over his conservatism because he is
 from New York
- Says Federalist Society and Sessions vetted

You're still doing OK in your financials?
- I want to give back, put back... Make America great again

Balanced budget?
- Some people say in 20 years, way less than that

Obamacare?
- You don't even have to repeal it, will collapse of its own weight
- New numbers on Obamacare will come out in November right before the elect
ion and they are trying to change it
- Open it up to competition
- Premiums and deductibles are so high

Promises?
- Giving speech on energy independence in North Dakota next week
- Need to rebuild depleted military
