Just spoke to Shana. She's the one. She said she knows all the players on both sides and she has her marching orders from the senator. She already had Garret's number.  She also said that there are more of "us" than there are of "them" and the senator has been making calls all day since he spoke to you.  They are delighted that you are in Alaska.  Have fun and make sure your baby girl has a great time.   I don't have words for your so-called political shop.   Call Shana first!!!
