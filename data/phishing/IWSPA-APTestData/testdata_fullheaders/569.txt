Dear Friends,




I'm writing to invite you to join the "Big Campaign" Google Group email
list. 




The list is unofficial-it doesn't belong to any group or organization. It is
a place to share with other progressives who are doing messaging,
communications and press or public outreach around the 2015 
election-including messaging about John McCain. 




This list is only for people doing Independent work (PACs, unions, 527s,
c4s). No parties or their committees. No candidates or their committees.




On a typical day somebody might send around press clips, breaking news, an
invitation to a poll briefing by their organization, circulate oppo research
tidbits or a link to a video clip. Email traffic could be as few as 2-3
messages a day or as many as 10-12 emails. This is not a discussion list-it
is for announcements.




List members include campaigners from different groups, union political
staff, communications and press staff, researchers, the staff of the
Campaign to Defend America and people involved work at the national level
and at the state and local level.




There are two ways to join.




1.	If you're new to Google Groups you can send an email to Ryan Duncan
and request to join the Big Campaign list. His email is
user@domain.com and phone is 202-609-7682




2.	Or, if you're already on another GoogleGroup you can email: 

user@domain.com and easily join.




IMPORTANT: feel free to invite your colleagues and collaborators.




I look forward to seeing you on the list.




Warm Regards,




Tom Matzzie
