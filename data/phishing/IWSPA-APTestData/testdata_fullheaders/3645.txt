John --

Right now, some people on the No-Fly List -- people
suspected of potential terrorist activity -- can legally
walk into a store and buy a gun. And leadership in the House
of Representatives is currently blocking a vote on
bipartisan legislation that would close this loophole and
help keep our communities safe.

Fortunately, some members of Congress have taken the
initiative and are circulating a petition that would force a
vote. Every single member of Congress should be signing on
-- there's no real argument against it.

OFA is standing up to the gun-lobby -- show your support for
common-sense gun safety measures like closing the No-Fly
Loophole:

The influence of well-financed special interests groups on
Congress is a major obstacle standing in the way of reform
-- and it's been going on for too long.

There are common-sense steps we can take to end gun violence
in this country, but Congress has failed to act. This won't
be the last reform we need, but it should be the next one.

Let's make it happen -- add your name:

Thanks,

Jennifer
