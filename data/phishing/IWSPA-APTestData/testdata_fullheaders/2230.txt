							Dear College alumni and friends,



							The new academic year has arrived! This week, we will welcome more than 24,000 undergraduates and 2,700 graduate students back to campus and the UCLA College. UCLA is humming with activity, and new students already are beginning to find their way around.



							The nearly 5,000 incoming freshmen and 3,000 transfer students are among the brightest and most accomplished in UCLA history. Our freshman class has an average weighted GPA of 4.32 and average SAT scores of 1941, nearly 400 points higher than the national average. Our transfer students have an average GPA of 3.76 and come from all over California.



							Our new students are now part of a vast and proud Bruin family that includes some of the most accomplished figures in society, from Rhodes Scholars to Pulitzer Prize-winners to Nobel Laureates. And they’ll have access to 115 majors, 80 minors, and 61 freshmen seminars, which were recently singled out by The New Yorker as a key element of what makes our public institution among the best.



							We encourage you to return to campus and contribute your time and experience to our students, either as a mentor, panelist or guest speaker. If you don’t live nearby, you can always connect with us through our Facebook page or website, where you can get updates on the dynamic teaching and high-impact research happening every day at the UCLA College.



							Please join us in wishing a warm welcome to all of our students. We look forward to a great year.



							Sincerely,



							Joseph Rudnick
