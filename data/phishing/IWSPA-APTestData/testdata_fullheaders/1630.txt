Dear Amy,

 <<link>>

 <<link>>      

Ten years ago when the first Alliance school opened, our leaders knew that the single most important factor to fulfill our mission of graduating students "college-ready" would be in attracting and retaining talented, committed, and exceptional teachers. Since that day, Alliance has been uniquely focused on recruiting and developing outstanding teachers who are committed to preparing students for success in college and beyond. 

 <<link>>
Today we are an organization of more than 500 teachers serving 11,000 students across our 26 schools. This week all of these teachers are gathering for a week-long training that allows teachers to collaborate, learn from each other and prepare for the new school year. This is just one of the ways that Alliance supports our teachers.



As a new Alliance teacher six years ago, I experienced this support firsthand. Like many of my colleagues, I sought out an opportunity to work in an urban school, where students were most in need of a great education. I chose Alliance because it offered small learning communities where I could make the most difference in the lives of our students, and because I knew that I would be supported in the challenging but rewarding work of teaching in the communities we serve.

I would not be where I am today without the support I received from other teachers at my school, my principal, and the Alliance home office. Alliance invests significant time and resources in its teachers.  In addition to the Summer Conference and similar trainings, new teachers receive regular feedback and one-on-one coaching as well as specialized training to adopt new curricula or develop innovative teaching methods. In my new role as English Language Arts Common Core Implementation Coach, I now work with both new and veteran Alliance teachers to develop curriculum, share best practices, and implement new ideas, particularly as we transition to the Common Core State Standards.
