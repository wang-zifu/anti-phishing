Realizing Jen is making edits presently, I have three flags:

1. I also dislike the current reference to her 2015 Blackberry. As written,
it seems like a strained attempt to make her seem relatable. If the point
of it is to say that she was used to having only one email when she was a
senator, and simply wanted to continue that arrangement when she became
Secretary, then the Blackberry reference would make sense bc it would help
explain how she made this decision in the first place. But it needs to be
rewritten to be understood that way.

2. This line - "=E2=80=8EThis process of looking backwards to see if someth
ing
should have been classified at the time is fine" - is problematic. We
should not think it is fine to find something that "should have been
classified at the time." Our position is that no such material exists, else
it could be said she mishandled classified info. We need to clarify to make
clear we mean that it is fine to perform redactions today, but in doing so
it doesnt mean that the material was classified at the time it was sent.

3. In this line - "Some will be serious, some will be personal or mundane"
- the word "serious" reads ominously/ suggestive of wrongdoing. I would say
something like "some will give a real window into the day-to-day workings
of the State Department..."
