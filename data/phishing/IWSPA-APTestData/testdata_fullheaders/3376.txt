Friend,

The same national organization that's already spent more
than $5 million attacking Terry McAuliffe just gave Ken
Cuccinelli's campaign another million dollars!

Math's not my strong domain.com, but that means they've spent a
total of $6.8 million so far -- almost approaching a dollar
per Virginian.

That much money will make a real difference for the
Cuccinelli campaign. It could pay for direct mail to
thousands of voters, go towards blanketing the state in
radio ads, or (and this is most likely) buy a whole lot of
attack ads on TV across the Commonwealth.

If Terry is going to keep up, he needs our help. When I heard
about the donation, I knew I had to do everything I could --
and that I had to check in with you to see if you'd join me.

Will you donate $5 right now to help Terry? His team needs
to raise $25,000 by midnight tonight to counter these
damaging RGA-funded attacks:

Terry is the only person that can stop Ken Cuccinelli's
extreme right-wing agenda from becoming a very scary reality
for Virginia and national Republicans know it.

News just broke that Jeb Bush is coming to town to raise
money for Cuccinelli's campaign. And that's on top of the
fundraising trips already planned by Rand Paul, Ted Cruz,
and Marco Rubio!

There aren't a lot of competitive races this year, so
Republicans -- who want a big win to build momentum for next
year's elections -- know electing Tea Party darling Ken
Cuccinelli is their best shot.

They're all in. And they'll come out on top if we're not all
in for Terry McAuliffe, too.

Chip in $5 right now to make sure Terry hits his fundraising
goal before midnight:

<<link>>

I can't emphasize enough that this is a critical moment for
you to support Terry. We need to stop Jeb Bush and his
friends from pushing Cuccinelli into the lead right now --
it'll be much harder to fight our way back from behind.

We're all counting on you,

James Carville
