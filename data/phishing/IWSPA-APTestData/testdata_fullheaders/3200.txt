Zakaria and Mike Rodgers: here<<<link>>>

Can anyone guess what the word of the day was?

Fareed ZAKARIA: "It was sort of rambling to the point of being incoherent."

                O ZAKARIA: "And I thought when he tried to flesh out an actual foreign policy, it was pretty incoherent."

                O ZAKARIA: "Certainly, it didn't strike me as a careful analytic laying out of a trump foreign policy."

MIKE RODGERS: "It was not exactly coherent."
