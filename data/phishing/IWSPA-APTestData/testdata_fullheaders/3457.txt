Memo to Members of Congress: Don=E2=80=99t Be on the Wrong Side  of History

Today it would be hard to find one member of Congress who openly  advocates

the abolition of Medicare or Social Security.  It=E2=80=99s true that durin
g the
Bush  Presidency right-wing Republicans tried to weaken, dilute and privati
ze 
both.  But their proposals were  always passed off as attempts to =E2=80=9C
strengthen=E2=80=9D these programs that have become  two of the most popula
r and widely
respected institutions of  government.
Of course it wasn=E2=80=99t always so.  Both Social Security and Medicare w
ere
incredibly controversial when they  were passed =E2=80=93 the first in 1937
 and the
second in 1964. In fact, their opponents  sounded very much like today=E2
=80=99s
Republicans as they denounced them for being =E2=80=9Cbig  government takeo
vers=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 or, in
the case of Medicare, =E2=80=9Csocialized  medicine.=E2=80=9D
But it wasn=E2=80=99t long after they were enacted that Social Security and



Medicare became =E2=80=9Cthird rails=E2=80=9D in American politics.  Former
 Senator Bob Dole once
made a  speech where he said: =E2=80=9CI was there, fighting against Medica
re.=E2=80=9D 
The TV spot reprising that speech during  his 1996 campaign against Bill
Clinton helped seal Dole=E2=80=99s defeat. 
The view shared by most Americans =E2=80=93 and all senior citizens =E2=80
=93 was summed 
up in the slogan for the 2015 campaign to defeat Bush=E2=80=99s privatizati
on
program:  =E2=80=9CHands off my Social Security.=E2=80=9D
No one brags that their father or grandfather lead the fight to oppose 
Social Security or Medicare =E2=80=93 any more than they brag that their fo
rbearer lead
 the fight against civil rights.  But  of course in the 1960=E2=80=99s, civ
il
rights did not have the universal acclaim it has  today.  
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had many detractors who thought his agitation 

for justice was downright subversive. Others thought that he wanted to move

too  fast. That extended to the Pastors =E2=80=93 many men of good will =E2
=80=93 who asked
him to  call off his protests in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963.  It was to
those Pastors that he wrote  his famous letter from the Birmingham jail: 
=E2=80=9CWhy
We Can=E2=80=99t domain.com.=E2=80=9D  
In 1963 most people would not have dreamed that just a few decades hence, 

a national holiday would be named after the young organizer and agitator,

Martin  Luther King. 
Every major social advance is  surrounded by controversy and conflict.  Tha
t
=E2=80=99s because every time there is change in the status quo there are  
winners
and losers.  The controversy  over President Obama=E2=80=99s health care re
form does
not center mainly on =E2=80=9Cdifferences  in approach=E2=80=9D or academic
 disagreements
over the way that health care systems  should be designed in some ideal
world.  They center instead on battles over wealth and power =E2=80=93 just
 as they did 
when the Congress created Social Security or Medicare, or passed the Civil 

Rights Act of 1964.  
That=E2=80=99s why the 19th Century abolitionist leader Frederick  Douglass
 was
right: =E2=80=9CYou can=E2=80=99t have the rain without the thunder and lig
htning,=E2=80=9D  he said. 
Of course Douglass was  referring to the granddaddy of all major social
change in our history -- the end  of slavery. That required a horrific civi
l
war.  
Health care reform involves one out of every six dollars spent in  America

today.  It involves the jobs and livelihoods of  millions of people and the

fortunes of huge corporations. Of course change in the health care system 

is going to be controversial. Luckily it is not controversial with average 

Americans.  On the health care  issue, Democrats =E2=80=93 and the Presiden
t =E2=80=93 have
the political high ground.  But that doesn=E2=80=99t mean it isn=E2=80=99t 
 controversial
with the insurance companies or with wealthy Americans who may be  asked to

pay a small increase in taxes (bringing their rates to the level they  were

in the Reagan Administration) in order to pay for needed  reform.
Members of Congress can=E2=80=99t avoid  the controversy.  If they want to,
  they
should look for another line of work.  All they can do is hope to be on the

right side of history =E2=80=93 to take  positions that their grandchildren
 will brag
about after they are long  gone.  
All that they can hope =E2=80=93 or any of us can hope =E2=80=93 is that th
e things we do 
will stand up to the test of history =E2=80=93 that they will make future

generations  proud. 
Forty years ago today, for the first time in history, human beings first 

set foot on another celestial object when Neil Armstrong planted his boot

print  on the moon. I was one of the millions of Americans who got up in th
e
early  morning hours to witness first-hand the historic event live on
television. It  was extraordinary =E2=80=93 a phenomenal evolutionary advan
ce for our
species =E2=80=93 brought  to us live from outer space. 
Less than a decade before, another young President challenged American to 

put that man on the moon. John Kennedy=E2=80=99s vision put America in the 

forefront of the technological revolution that created the jobs of the futu
re -- 
for a generation of Americans.
This year, President Obama challenged us again =E2=80=93 to create the jobs
 of  the
future for our generation: millions of clean energy jobs. 
Last month, the House of Representatives voted to meet that challenge =E2
=80=93 
passing an energy bill that will finally begin to break our dependence on 

foreign oil and make America a world leader in clean  energy technologies o
f
the future.  Now, members of the Senate will have to decide which side of

history they  will be on when it comes to creating a clean energy economy.

In the next two weeks, Members of both the House and Senate will be  called

upon to decide which side of history they will be on when it comes to 
ending our status as the only nation in the industrial world that does not 

guarantee health care as a human right. 
The Obama health  care bill is controversial because it will control the
growth of health care  premiums for American families.  That, in turn, will

take money from the pockets of some of the most  powerful special interests
 in
the country =E2=80=93 most notably the insurance  industry.  
But it is safe to say that one  day, future generations will look back on

this battle and wonder way it wasn=E2=80=99t  obvious to everyone that ever
y person
has a right to health care =E2=80=93 they same way  we look back today and 
wonder how
anyone could have supported slavery.  Remember we still had slavery in 
America just 150 years ago. 
Our grandkids will wonder why anyone would balk at beginning to 
rationalize the bloated, inefficient American health care system that leave
s us  37th
in the world in health care outcomes and costs us 50% more per  person than

any other country on the domain.com. 
They will look back on those who  tried to stand in the way of serious
health care reform, the way we look back on  those who tried to block the

creation of Social Security or Medicare or the  Civil Rights Act. 
Often, when political leaders are faced with historic choices, they are 
forced to choose between the next election =E2=80=93 and the next generatio
n.  This
time, with the political wind at  our back, they don=E2=80=99t have to make
 that
choice.  But they do have to choose to stand up  against special interest

pressure and act decisively to take the actions that  are necessary to buil
d a
foundation for the long-term economic success of future  generations of
Americans. 
So in the next few weeks, talk to  your Members of Congress.  Ask them 
each what kind of legacy they want to leave after their political career is



done.  Tell them to stop worrying so  much what the lobbyists and big
contributors think about their decisions and ask  themselves how those deci
sions
will be viewed by history.
