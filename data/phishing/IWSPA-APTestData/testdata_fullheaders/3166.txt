Manafort:

Paul Ryan's comments surprised us
Several people have hesitated [to endorse], but many have not
Meetings next week with the GOP leadership to unify

Taco Bowl?

-          People thought it was an acknowledgement of importance of Cinco de Mayo

-          Not stereotyping ethnic groups

Carson saying Democrat possibly as VP?

-          Only one person to listen to about this process-Donald Trump

-          Most important thing is what Donald Trump says. People voting top of ticket

Manafort says Trump was the one to reach out to Ryan to set up meeting

-          Trump comes to Washington with strong support

Campaign financing hypocrisy?

-          No. Trump now represents the GOP

-          As leader of the GOP, has to help raise money

Past representation of pro-Russian forces. Conflict with Trump classified briefings?
(Largely dodged)

-          No current clients

-          Trump getting briefings, not me

-          Don't represent them anymore

-          No expectation that Trump will share briefings with me

Reaching out to Kasich and Cruz?

-          Would be interested in talking to all of them

HRC email controversy?

-          HRC character will be part of fall campaign
