SSN Awards Season Overview: Oscar Potential Contenders

2013 has been a fantastic year in film – which makes awards season all the more exciting. Starting today SSN will be bringing you exclusive awards interviews, analysis, and updates. To kick off our awards season coverage, here are our top picks for awards season. (SSN)

Why Are So Many Oscar Hopefuls Based on a True Story?

Two of the last three Best Picture winners were based on true stories, and this year, 12 Years a Slave, Captain Phillips, American Hustle, Saving Mr. Banks, Lee Daniels’ The Butler, Dallas Buyers Club, Fruitvale Station, and Lone Survivor are all legitimate contenders for a Best Picture nod. The sheer number of movies based on real events this year is enough for any industry watcher to sit up and take notice. (SSN)
