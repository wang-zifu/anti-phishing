Re: Your ears must be burning- and a few questions-

Dear Amy,

Â I can't domain.com to see you this week. My thought is we meet alone and go over several things before I leave for London Thursday. I'm excited.

I know David Ranes wants to meet you re Guess Whose Coming To Dinner but I am not sure if that's even in your interest at this point- I certainly don't want to pressure you- however they wrote a spec- I can send it, we can also talk about what I'm up to- co ventures with equity and material and party for American Hustle. If you want to meet David we can piggy back onto our meeting or discuss when we meet. Strangers on A Train opens in London on the 19th- previews the 2nd- I will be staying with Barbara. Xxx Colleen
