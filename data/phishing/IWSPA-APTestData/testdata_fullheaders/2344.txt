Ok, please let me know early, if they can't deliver, we'll go to FedEx Kinkos for our comm staffers who need them for White House Correspondents Weekend events where they'll need to be able to network with dozens if not hundreds of reporters. Thank you.

User,

I sent a request for delivery date update to our printer but because we have to print union, I likely won't hear until their day starts again tomorrow. If we do get them tomorrow, Noah will bring them over immediately. The order was placed for the set as soon as we got your approval on Monday so we are working to get these as quickly as possible, but because we print union unfortunately it does take longer than a non-union solution would. Believe me - it is equally as frustrating to us in most cases!

I appreciate your patience.
