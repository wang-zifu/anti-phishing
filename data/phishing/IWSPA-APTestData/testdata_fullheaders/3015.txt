John,

On Memorial Day, we remember the men and women who gave their lives in 
service of our country over the past 239 years. We salute their honor and 
their bravery today and every day.

I've been honored to meet so many local veterans and members of the next 
generation of military leaders currently studying at West Point. Today I 
am thinking of them and the millions of servicemen and women, veterans, 
military families, and countless others who are bravely serving our 
country and protecting our freedom.

In their honor, I want to draw your attention to an amazing organization, 
Honor Flight, which helps aging veterans from around the country fulfill 
their dreams of visiting the World War II memorial in Washington.

Click here to learn more about the wonderful work Honor Flight is doing 
for our nation's veterans.

Honor Flight began in Ohio shortly after the World War II memorial opened 
in 2004. Physician Assistant and retired Air Force Captain Earl Morse saw 
that many of his patients were WWII veterans who, because of health or 
financial reasons, had no foreseeable way of getting to Washington to see 
the monument erected to honor them and their fallen comrades.

Soon after that Earl, also a private pilot, used his own time and 
resources to escort a patient to the memorial -- it was the first honor 
flight and was a resounding success. Since then, Honor Flight has taken 
almost 100,000 veterans to see their memorial in Washington. This past 
April, Hudson Valley Honor Flight took their fourth journey with more than 
100 World War II veterans.

It's an amazing story. Veterans' rights are an issue extremely close to my 
heart, so I'm happy to see an organization providing such a valuable 
service to our veterans.

I hope you'll join me and take a minute this Memorial Day to check out 
Honor Flight and see how they're honoring our veterans every day.

Don't forget to show the veterans in your life a little extra love today.

Thanks,

Sean
