a note from ed wyatt -- personal

Michael -- Hello -- it's been awhile since I've seen you; I hope that you and the family are well and that you are getting some time off this summer. I'll be out in LA at the end of July to pick up Sadie from camp; perhaps we could have coffee or a brief domain.com.

I'm writing because I'm thinking strongly about a career change, and intellectual property is one great interest of mine. I applied to MPAA for an open position as director of academic outreach, overseeing relations with academic groups conducting IP research. (listing is here: <<link>> ) But I'm sure you know that responding to job listings isn't often successful. Would you have some time to talk on the phone about IP in the entertainment business, and people who you know here in D.C. who might be good for me to meet? I am committed to staying here in D.C. for the next several years.

I appreciate any help or advice you might be able to share. If there is a good time to talk, let me know. Thanks, Ed.

Ed Wyatt
