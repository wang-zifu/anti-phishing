CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 - International




CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 earned an estimated $11.5 million overseas for a total of $70.3 million.




We had one new opening this week.  Hungary debuted to $.135, about 60% bigger than CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEALTBALLS.  




Excellent holds this week, including U.K. which just about matched last weekend's take for a cume of $14.4 -- about 30% over the lifetime of the original film in just its 2nd frame.  Germany gained 5% over last weekend, earning $2.7, cume $6.9 and  Russia did $2.6 ($7.5).




Argentina and Taiwan open this week.
