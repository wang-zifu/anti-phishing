Also
I signed a conflict of interest policy as a board member of cgi
On it, I wrote that my wife designs bags for cgi, and loses money doing so 
plus donating her time
And that teneo represents 4 cgi sponsors, 3 of which teneo brought to cgi
.
Oddly, wjc does not have to sign such a document even though he is personal
ly paid by 3 cgi sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that a
re at home etc

I could add 500 different examples of things like this and while I removed 
lasry bc they are all on the offense, I get the sense that they are trying 
to put some sort of wrong doing on me after the domain.com as a crutch to change
 things and if I don't mention things like lasry where they all have issues
, I may regret it
