You are now officially @UserUser- your old login information for User should work to get in, and all of your old content is there. I just double-checked, and the Twitter account listed on your Medium account automatically updated. You'll probably have to change others manually though (do you list it on LinkedIn?)

We also still have User. I just put up a quick bio directing people to your new account, and a black and white version of your Twitter avatar. You can make whatever edits there you want, but I would leave something up that acknowledges that this used to be you, and redirecting people to the right place.

Password is 14milJOBS!, but you can change it. I would log in once to change the email address to one you own (it's currently my gmail).

Let me know if you have questions, but you should be all set.
