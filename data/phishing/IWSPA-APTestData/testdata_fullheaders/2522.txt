Hey Josh, I'm already in at WHCD as is the Chair. However, if you have extra slots you get for those back tables for junior staff, it would be great if we could take care of extra Organizationcomm staffers who as you know I've made sure are aggressive about touting the progress we've made over the last 7 years.
