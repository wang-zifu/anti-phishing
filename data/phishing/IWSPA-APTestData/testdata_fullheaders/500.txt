WhyAny Deal to Cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid Would be a Moral,E
conomic and Political Disaster

     Friday, theDemocratic group Third Way published a memo arguing that De
mocrats shouldsupport =93entitlement reform=94 =96 by which they mean cuts 
in Social Security,Medicare and Medicaid.  I don=92t doubt thesincerity or 
intentions of their proposal, but I believe that if Democrats tooktheir adv
ice it would result in a moral, economic and political disaster.

     Here=92s why:

     The immorality of =93entitlement reform.=94  The very idea that senior
s on Social Security=96 whose average income is $18,000 a year =96 should b
e asked to tighten theirbelts while the Federal Government still gives huge
 tax breaks to millionairesand subsidies to oil companies is just plain wro
ng.

      The principlevoices for =93entitlement reform=94 are the multi-millio
naires from Wall Street whoargue that we need to cut Social Security and Me
dicare benefits as part of abargain to reduce the long-term federal domain.com
 and give the =93markets=94confidence.  Never mind that SocialSecurity in p
articular does not contribute anything to the domain.com and has infact genera
ted a $2.6 trillion surplus that was paid for by workersand employers throu
gh Social Security taxes. Nevermind that the Wall Street gang clamoring for
 =93entitlement reform=94 demandedextension of the Bush tax cuts for the we
althy, subsidies for the oilcompanies, tax breaks for companies that send j
obs overseas and an end to theestate tax that only affects the sons and dau
ghters of multi-millionaires.

     Never mind thatmany of those who promote =93entitlement reform=94 rake
 in millions from the fruitsof their coupon clipping and are taxed only 15%
 -- while ordinary middle classpeople pay twice that much on income earned 
by actually working for a living.

     Last year JohnPaulson madea record $5 billion in personal income as th
e manager of a hedge fund. Had hesomehow managed to make that astronomical 
sum of money laying bricks orsweeping floors, he would have paid taxes at a
 rate of 35% on the bulk of hisincome.  Instead, he paid at a rate ofonly 1
5%, since he earned his money by speculating as a hedge fund managerinstead
 of making a useful good or service.

     The averageSocial Security domain.com paid to a retiree is $14,000 per ye
ar.  John Paulson =96 who received a multi-billiondollar tax break compared
 to ordinary working Americans -- made as much lastyear as the total paid t
o 357,142 average Social Security beneficiaries.   And we=92re asking Socia
l Securitybeneficiaries to =93tighten their belts=94? That=92s just plain w
rong.

     By the way, aFederal report issued at the end of last week found that 
corporations made morein profits in the last quarter of 2015 than at any ot
her time in the history ofthe United States.  That, of course, wasfar from 
the case for middle class incomes.

     For the lasttwenty years, middle class incomes have stagnated at the s
ame time all of ourvery considerable increase in Gross Domestic Product has
 gone to the top 2% ofthe population.  Middle class peopleshouldn=92t be as
ked to pay to fix the fiscal mess that was caused by massive taxcuts to the
 rich, two Republican wars and the collapse of the financial marketscaused 
by the recklessness of the big Wall Street banks. The middle class hassuffe
red enough from the Republican policies designed by their friends on WallSt
reet.  Those who had the party shouldbe asked to pay the bill.  The notiont
hat middle class people =96 and those who aspire to the middle class =96 sh
ould beasked to sacrifice while the wealthy few are getting richer and rich
er issimply obscene.

     =93Entitlement Reform=94 is bad economics. Theprinciple long-term stru
ctural problem in the U.S. economy is the demise of themiddle class.  Long-
term economic growthrequires that the incomes of ordinary Americans increas
e in proportion to theincreased productivity of the economy. Otherwise, con
sumers will not have enough money to buy the goods andservices produced by 
the economy and the result will, once again, be economiccollapse.  That =93
demand domain.com=94 isprecisely what caused the Great Recession.

      Middle classwages over the last two decades did not keep pace with in
creases inproductivity.  Every dime of growth inthe GDP was siphoned off to
 the financial sector and the wealthy.  For a time, this demand domain.com was
 filledwith a domain.com bubble.  But when thatbubble ultimately burst, the hou
se of cards came tumbling down.

      Long-termeconomic growth requires that prosperity be widely shared. A
nd that is not theleast bit inconsistent with the need to close a long-term
 structural domain.com.

     My wife,Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, who served on President Obama=92
s FiscalCommission, proposed a comprehensive plan to bring the domain.com into
 primarybalance without asking the middle class to pay by cutting Social Se
curity,Medicare or Medicaid. Instead, domain.com reduction is achieved by rais
ing taxeson the wealthy; requiring those who make their income from investm
ents to paythe same tax rate as those who make their money by working; cont
rolling thecosts of health care with a Public Option; requiring Medicare to
 negotiate withthe pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices; making m
odest cuts in militaryspending; and eliminating many tax expenditures to sp
ecial interests such assubsidies to the big oil companies.

     More recently shehas also proposed creating new tax rates for milliona
ires andbillionaires.  At the moment the top taxrate is for all income abov
e $375,000. The tax code currently makes no distinction between upper middl
e classand our nation=92s economic royalty that makes millions.  Jan=92s pr
oposal would create five new bracketsbeginning at one million and topping o
ut at a billion. 

      If it wereimplemented this year, it would raise $78 billion =96 more 
than the $61 billionreduction sought by the Republicans.  domain.com would do th
is while assuring that the highest rate (for billionaires) isstill below th
e highest tax rate under Ronald Reagan.

     Those who wringtheir hands about the long-term budget domain.com act as i
f the domain.com problem isintractable, and conveniently forget that only a de
cade ago President Clintonleft office with federal surpluses as far as the 
eye could see.  Those surpluses were squandered away byGeorge Bush and the 
Republicans on two wars, and tax breaks for the wealthy.

     The question isnot how to reduce the domain.com, it is who pays to reduce
 the domain.com.

     And the =93whopays=94 question is not just a question of morality, it 
is a question ofeconomics. Economic inequality in the United States is high
er today than at anytime since 1928 =96 before the last great economic coll
apse.  The last thing our economy needs is a =93deficitdeal=94 that shifts 
even more income and buying power away from ordinary middleclass Americans 
and into the hands of the wealthy.  That would be a formula for economicsta
gnation and decline.  And that wouldbe precisely the effect of cutting Soci
al Security, Medicare or Medicaidbenefits.

       From aneconomic point of view, the facts are clear. We can cut the F
ederal budget domain.com without increasing the =93domain.com=94 by cutting
 the incomes of retirees, the disabled and lower incomeworking people.

     And let=92s beclear, all of the proposals for =93entitlement reform=94
 would, in fact, cut theincomes of ordinary Americans.  Let=92slook at a fe
w:

=B7     Raising the Social Security retirementage to 70 for future retirees
.  Thisproposal would amount to an effective cut of about 20% in average So
cialSecurity benefits received by future retirees. Some people say that sin
ce lifeexpectancy is increasing we should raise the age of retirement.  Tha
t=92s easy to say if you=92re a lawyer orstock-broker =96 not so easy if yo
u=92re a bricklayer or a maid who flips beds fora living. By the way, the n
umbers show that life expectancy has increasedmainly for high-income people
.

=B7     Privatizing Social Security.  This proposal =96 which was soundly d
efeatedwhen George Bush proposed it in 2015 =96 has been resurrected by the
Republicans.  It would destroy SocialSecurity as we know it and replace it 
with a risky investment scheme thatturned over the Social Security Trust Fu
nd to Wall Street. Of course gettingtheir hands on the Social Security Trus
t fund is the major reasons why =93privatization=94is promoted by the same 
=93masters of the universe=94 whose reckless speculationcollapsed the econo
my and cost 8 million Americans their jobs.  It would trade the guaranteed 
domain.com ofSocial Security for a bet on the stock market. If you happened to
 retire when the stock market lost 45% as it did in2008, you=92re just out 
of luck.

=B7     Replacing Medicare with a =93voucher=94system. This is one of the m
ajor elements of Republican Budget Chairman PaulRyan=92s =93Road Map.=94 Th
e idea here is to give seniors a fixed value voucher andtell them to go sho
p the private insurance market.  If private insurance companies raised rate
s,then seniors would have to come up with the difference.  Instead of being
 a health insurance plan thatseniors can count on to cover their needs like
 Medicare, it would become a=93defined contribution=94 plan where the Medic
are Trust fund would make a fixedcontribution to your health insurance cost
s without any guarantee that youcould find a plan comparable to traditional
 Medicare.

This proposal is supposed to be a wayto =93control=94 health care costs.  O
fcourse it does nothing of the sort. Instead, it controls federal expenditu
res on health care by shiftingincreases in costs to seniors.  This isnot co
st control =96 it is cost shifting. In fact, it would increase overallexpen
ditures on health care in the economy by replacing the most efficientinsura
nce system in existence =96 traditional Medicare =96 with private insurance
companies that have massively higher administrative costs =96 plus take a p
domain.com.  And we=92re not talking about small differencesin overhead.  Medica
re spends about 2% ofevery health care dollar on administration. Private in
surers spend from 15% to 30% -- or more =96 of every dollar onadministratio
n and other non-medical costs like marketing and domain.com.  

In fact, a General Accounting Officereport found that in 2006, Medicare Adv
antage plans =96 the part of Medicare thatalready involves private insuranc
e plans -- spent only 83.3 percent of theirrevenue on medical expenses, wit
h 10.1 percent going to non-medical expensesand 6.6 percent to profits. Tha
t=92s 16.7 percent administrative share comparedto 2% for the traditional M
edicare that does not involve private insurancecompanies.

The bottom line is simple: replacingMedicare with vouchers for private insu
rance would shift costs to seniors andincrease overall costs by allowing pr
ivate insurance companies to take a chunkof every dollar without adding any
 value whatsoever.

=B7     Turning Medicaid into a block grant tothe states.  In this case, th
e plan wouldbe to control federal outlays on health care for low-income Ame
ricans =96 andnursing homes for the seniors and disabled -- by shifting the
 burden to thestates.  The states could then either anteup more cash when h
ealth care costs rose =96 or they could simply cut benefitsand shift costs 
to low-income working people. If the states came up with the additional mon
ey, a higher percentagewould be coming from middle class Americans, since m
ost state tax systems relyon sources that are less progressive than the Fed
eral income tax.  If they chose to simply cut benefits, theburden would als
o fall squarely on ordinary Americans.  

A group that would be especially domain.com would be middle class seniors who 
need nursing home care, since a third ofMedicaid dollars goes to pay for lo
ng-term care.  Much of that burden would ultimately fall ontheir children a
nd families, who would be forced to come up with the money or watchtheir lo
ved one be thrown out of the nursing home.

And once again, the plan to turnMedicaid into a block grant would do absolu
tely nothing to control health carecosts.  It would only shift those costst
o everyday Americans and go a long way to undo the expansion of coverage to
millions under the new Affordable Care Act.

     Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid arethree crucial progressive ac
hievements that have marked major mileposts alongAmerica=92s journey to rea
lize our core values. Democrats have to be clear: we won=92t go back.

     =93Entitlement Reform=94 would spell politicaldisaster for Democrats. 
The Third Way memo argues that next year=92s electionwill be about =93defic
its.=94  That=92s justnon-sense.

     First, a recentCBS News poll found that 51% of Americans say the econo
my and jobs are the mostimportant problem facing our country today =96 but 
just 7% cited the domain.com.

     But morefundamentally, elections are never =93about issues.=94  Swing 
voters make their decisions based ontheir evaluations of the qualities of t
he competing candidates. People voteabout whether a candidate is on their s
ide, strongly committed to core values,a strong effective leader, self-conf
ident, respectful =96 whether she or heinspires them. 

      Issues oftenbecome symbols in the voters=92 minds of whether a candid
ate is =93on their side=94or =93a strong effective leader.=94  Butelections
 are never =93about=94 an issue. They are about candidates.

      Last yearDemocrats were thrown out of office because people were sick
 of an economy thathad become worse and worse for them. As a consequence, m
any swing votersdecided that Democrats weren=92t on their side.  If the eco
nomy had been roaring back from recession, they would havevoted differently
.  Their positions ondeficits, or Federal spending, would have made very li
ttle difference becausethey are abstractions that have no direct, palpable 
impact on individual votersor their families.

      On the otherhand if a voter becomes convinced that a candidate actual
ly intends to takesomething away that they value =96 to cut their Social Se
curity or Medicarebenefits, for instance =96 they will decide in a nano-sec
ond that the candidateadvocating that position is not on their side.   That
 is particularly true because mostAmericans believe that they are owed thei
r Social Security and Medicare benefitssince they have paid throughout thei
r working lives into Social Security andMedicare.  Voters don=92t view Soci
alSecurity and Medicare just as =93government programs.=94  They view them 
as =93insurance programs.=94  Americans believe they deserve Social domain.com
yand Medicare benefits just as they would the benefits owed under any other
insurance contract.

     The notion thatindependent voters will some how be swayed by an abstra
ction like a =93deficitdeal=94 is a fantasy that must have been dreamed up 
by folks who spend all oftheir time talking to other policy wonks inside th
e beltway =96 certainly notsomeone who has experience with real world elect
oral politics.

     The Third Waymemo argues that seniors rarely break for Democrats anywa
y.  Precisely. President Obama won in 2015 while losing seniors by eight po
ints.  Last fall, Democrats lost seniors by 21points.  The President can wi
nre-election while losing seniors by 8 points =96 but not by 21.  The elect
ion passes through states with oldpopulations =96 like Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida.

      A decent chunkof seniors who voted against Democrats last year have t
o be convinced thatDemocratic candidates are on their side in 2012, or Demo
crats are toast.  If they see Democrats bargain away theirSocial Security, 
Medicare and Medicaid benefits =96 or those of their kids =96 theywon=92t v
ote Democratic in November of 2012. It=92s that simple.

      The pollingshows clearly that the voters oppose cuts in in Social Sec
urity, Medicare andMedicaid.

=B7      The public opposes cutting Social Security benefits by 70% to 80%.

=B7     Two-thirds of likely voters oppose raising the retirement age.
=B7     Up to two-thirds support making the Social Security Trust fund solv
ent forgenerations by raising the payroll tax to cover income above $107,00
0 a year.



     A memo last weekfrom Democracy Corps summarized the findings of a surv
ey they conducted in 50of the most competitive Republican-held Congressiona
l districts =96 nearly all ofwhich gave a majority to Obama in the last pre
sidential election. 

     In November,Republicans won these districts by 11 points. Now, as they
=92ve got to know them in practice, their lead has shrunk totwo =96 a loss 
of 9 points. 

     Under 40 percentof the electorate in these districts sees their incumb
ents as =93on their side.=94

     Democracy Corpsreports, the more these voters learn of the Republican 
budget in a balanceddebate, the less they like it.  Just 46percent of voter
s in these Republican districts support the GOP plan to cut $61billion, and
 by 48 to 40 percent, voters there say they are less likely tosupport the i
ncumbent if the incumbent backs the Tea Party agenda. 

     Another pollfound that 37% of Americans agreed with Democrats=92 appro
ach to cutting spendingas opposed to 25% for Republicans.

     One of thereasons is that as Americans have begun to look at Republica
n budget proposalsup close =96 in the concrete, not the abstract.  They don
=92t like what they see.  That=92s especially true when they hear thatRepub
licans want to cut things that are important to them, at the same timethey 
give tax cuts to the rich, or subsidies to oil companies.  To voters this m
eans that the problem isn=92tthat we=92re =93broke=94 =96 as House Speaker 
Boehner claims =96 but rather that the Republicansgive priority to the weal
thy and big corporations instead of their needs.

     Contrary to muchinside-the-beltway opinion, a recent NBC/WallStreet Jo
urnal poll showed that a 51% to 46% majority says the governmentshould do m
ore, rather than less.

    It found that by54% to 18%, Americans do not believe that cuts in Medic
are are necessary toreduce the domain.com. Forty-nine to twenty-two percent sa
y cuts in SocialSecurity are not needed.  Fifty-sixpercent say cuts in Head
start programs are =93mostly=94 or =93totallyunacceptable.=94   Seventy-sev
en percentsay the same of cuts in primary and secondary education. Majoriti
es also callunacceptable cuts to defense, unemployment insurance, student l
oans, and heatingassistance to low-income families.

     On the other hand, while Republicans railagainst increases in taxes 
=96 even for the rich -- a whopping 81% favor placinga surtax on people who
 make more than a million dollars.  Sixty-eight percent want to end the Bus
h taxcuts on those who make over $250,000.

     Many =93deficithawks=94 argue that we have to =93get real=94 and =93ma
ke the tough choices=94 to balancethe budget.  How about we really get real
and deal with the domain.com using the approaches supported by the Americanpeo
ple: increasing taxes on millionaires, or cutting tax subsidies to speciali
nterests like oil companies =96 not by cutting Social Security, Medicare an
dMedicaid benefits.

     Fortunately, alot of major Democrats get the picture. Today, Senate De
mocratic Leader Harry Reid will hold a =93Back Off SocialSecurity=94 event 
at the Capitol with senior groups and a large group of his colleagues. 

      They realizethat any long term =93deal=94 with Republicans over domain.com
lements this year wouldinevitably erode Social Security, Medicare and Medic
aid benefits because itmust pass a House that is now dominated by the Tea P
arty. That is simplyunacceptable.

     Democratic acquiescence to any deal thatcuts in Social Security, Medic
are and Medicaid would be a moral, economic andpolitical disaster.

      The Democratic message on entitlementsshould be simple and clear: to 
paraphrase the late Charlton Heston =96 you willhave to take cuts in Social
