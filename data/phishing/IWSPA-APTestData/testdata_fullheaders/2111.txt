An interesting idea. Why don't Marc and I chat offline about this, and mayb
e include Mary Beth Goodman, since she has a good perspective on Treasury's
 view of some of these things, and then circle back with some ideas? Thanks

John

Absolutely worth discussing. The IPC focus was on avoiding a global race to
 the bottom on corporate tax- so it had a little more in mind that particul
ar oecd countries cut their corp tax to get companies to move to them (I th
ink Ireland is like the prototypical example). But definitely was global pr
oposal. Marc and perhaps Alex can discuss w John N areas of joint work.

Sort of buried in the back of the report is a section on tax avoidance and 
international tax competition which references some OECD lines of work
Africans are hepped up on having OECD help them on tracking illegal financi
al flows. This is area where there is little outside work or advocacy. I th
ink if Mark and John did some work combining the development challenge with
 the domestic issues/effects discussed in the. Commission Report, it could 
get noticed and have some impact. Best time to do that would be in the run 
up to the Financing for Development Conference taking place in I Addis this
 summer.
Worth discussing?
