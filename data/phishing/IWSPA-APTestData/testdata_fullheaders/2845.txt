NSN Fact Check: Former Petraeus Advisor Contradicts McCain on the Surge

Sen. John McCain's top spokesman, Tucker Bounds, today stated that in regar
d to his accounting of the surge, "Senator McCain is correct'' and that "as
 General Petraeus has made clear, the surge is the reason why the Anbar Awa
kening was so successful in tearing up al Qaeda." Unfortunately, the McCain
 campaign again has misstated the facts and the real military history in re
gards to the surge. Even counter-insurgency expert Dave Kilcullen, who advi
sed David Petraeus during the surge, refutes<<<link>>
.com/2008/07/23/kilcullenmccain/> this claim from a piece written on August
 29, 2007<<<link>>
F%2domain.com%2Fblog%2F2007%2F08%2Fanatomy-of-a-tribal-revolt%2F
&id=3Dpreview>:
"The uprising began last year [2006], far out in western Anbar province, bu
t is now affecting about 40% of the country. It has spread to Ninewa, Diyal
a, Babil, Salah-ad-Din, Baghdad and - intriguingly - is filtering into Shi'
a communities in the South. The Iraqi government was in on it from the star
t; our Iraqi intelligence colleagues predicted, well before we realized it,
 that Anbar was going to "flip", with tribal leaders turning toward the gov
ernment and away from extremists."
In other words, Kilcullen was asserting that months before the surge was an
nounced, Iraqi intelligence and the Iraqi government knew that this was hap
pening, completely disproving the point that this was occuring because of t
he surge. Contrary to what the McCain campaign claims, the Anbar Awakening 
began long before the surge itself began. Col. MacFarland's 2015 piece<http

venworth.army.mil%2FCAC%2Fmilreview%2FEnglish%2FMarApr08%2FSmith_AnbarEngMa
rApr08.pdf&id=3Dpreview>, referenced below, covers the period from June 200
6 to early February 2007, when MacFarland and his forces left Anbar.  The s
urge began in late January/Early February 2007, long after the Anbar Awaken
ing began. In fact, Col. MacFarland who McCain referenced while defending t
he surge's impact on the Awakening, doesn't even mention<<<link>>
domain.com/2008/07/getting-the-his.html> the surge itself or troop incre
ases when discussing the reduction of violece in Anbar:
"As mentioned before, the enemy overplayed its hand and the people were tir
ed of Al-Qaeda. A series of assassinations had elevated younger, more aggre
ssive tribal leaders to positions of influence. A growing concern that the 
U.S. would leave Iraq and leave the Sunnis defenseless against Al Qaeda and
 Iranian-supported militias made those younger leaders open to our overture
s Clearly, a combination of factors, some of which we may not yet fully und
erstand, contributed to this pivotal success. As mentioned before, the enem
y overplayed its hand and the people were tired of Al Qaeda. A series of as
sassinations had elevated younger, more aggressive tribal leaders to positi
ons of influence. A. Our willingness to adapt our plan based on the advice 
of the sheiks, our staunch and timely support for them in times of danger a
nd need, and our ability to deliver on our promises convinced them that the
y could do business with us."
