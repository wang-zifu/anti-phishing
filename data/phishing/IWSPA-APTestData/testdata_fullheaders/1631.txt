Per the Call, The Convention Rules Committee has jurisdiction to propose th
e Convention agenda, permanent Rules of the Convention, proposed amendments
 to party rules and any other matters not covered by the other standing com
mittees.

They do not draft the Delegate Selection Rules. That's done by the OrganizationRule
s & Bylaws Committee.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
