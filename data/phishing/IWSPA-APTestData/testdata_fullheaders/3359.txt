**Guess what? Since this supporter put together this
list, our economy has continued to add jobs. To date,
we've added nearly 5.2 million private sector jobs over
31 consecutive months.

What is this?

Every day from now until Election Day, we'll send you
something that makes the case for voting for Barack Obama.
Today, it's a supporter's handmade list of why they support
our president.

What can I do?

If you like it, we ask that you share it with any friends, family
members, and neighbors you know who are still making up
their mind about who to vote for (and everyone knows some).
All you have to do is pass it on -- forward it, share on Facebook,
or on Twitter.

Done. What else?

If you spot something that's especially persuasive or inspiring,
or if you want to share your own graphic, essay, or personal story,
send it on to user@domain.com and we'll pass the
best ones along.

With 12 days to go in this election, and millions of voters still
making up their minds, it's the job of everyone who supports
President Obama to let everyone else know who they're voting
for this year -- and why.

Thanks for your help.

Obama for America
