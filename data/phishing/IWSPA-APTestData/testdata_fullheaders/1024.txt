Eric,

So, I am planning my July holiday.  Right now it looks like June 29 and 30 London.  Then July 1 Stockholm and a ferry ride up to Turko,  Finland ( 7 hours).  Onto Helsinki (2 hours driving) and then a ferry to Tallinn, Estonia ( 2 hours ) and driving down to Lithuania and Latvia by July 10th.  I don't expect you to join for any of this, but you are very very welcome and it should be spectacular.  Come for part or all of it.  Riga and the Baltic coast are all beautiful and we will be in nice hotels.  From there we fly to Pisa, Italy and drive one hour to Punta Ala.  Here is where I think you want to join.  The golf course is amazing as is the coast.  The food is great.  We will be there for 3 or 4 days and you will love it.  With our without kids.  Come!
