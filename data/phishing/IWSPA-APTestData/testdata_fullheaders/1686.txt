User,

I sent a request for delivery date update to our printer but because we hav
e to print union, I likely won't hear until their day starts again tomorrow
. If we do get them tomorrow, Noah will bring them over immediately. The or
der was placed for the set as soon as we got your approval on Monday so we 
are working to get these as quickly as possible, but because we print union
 unfortunately it does take longer than a non-union solution would. Believe
 me - it is equally as frustrating to us in most cases!

I appreciate your patience.
Katja
