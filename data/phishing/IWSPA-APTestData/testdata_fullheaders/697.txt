FYI – In case ML hears about this, see below.  Sorkin just invoked my name, for no goddamn reason, and actually, completely inaccurately.  Been involving Michael Marshall on this the whole way.  I can update you if you want more, but I just didn’t want you surprised in case this came back through other channels. From: "Wolfson, Aimee" <Aimee_Wolfson@spe.sony.com>
