Dear Michael,




We would like to invite you to a small dinner that we are hosting for HBS Professor and Senior Associate Dean Bill Sahlman on Thursday, March 20.  Bill will share his current work in entrepreneurship at HBS as well as the vision for the School in the context of the upcoming Harvard Capital Campaign.  It is our hope that our time together will provide us with an opportunity to engage in a lively discussion and encourage us to think about how we might build a more engaged HBS communi
