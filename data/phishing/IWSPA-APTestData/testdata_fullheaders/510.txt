Amy --

Debates are springing up everywhere, because for the first time in decades we have a competitive race for County Supervisor in the Third District. This is great for LA County: Issues that directly affect everyone’s lives being discussed in front of many people all over the place.

Here are a few upcoming debates, hope you can come check them out. Seeing supporters in the audience means a lot to me!

Best,

Bobby
