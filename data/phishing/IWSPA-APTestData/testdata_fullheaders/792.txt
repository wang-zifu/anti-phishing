Hi Leah. The Entertainment Law Committee of the Langston Bar Asso. is holding a law student roundtable here in the SPP Atrium on Nov. 12, 2013.

They have asked me to participate as a panelist. I expect the main topic of discussion will be legal careers in the entertainment industry. I just wanted to run this past you to be sure no have no objections.
