Fwd: Shine a light

Amy, 

When it comes down to it, dark money groups are trying to take away one of our most basic rights – the right to choose who represents you in Washington. 

That’s what they’re doing when they spend millions of dollars swiftboating people like me with smear campaigns and attack ads. 

We’ve let it go on too long. But now we have a chance to put a stop to it and bring integrity back to our elections. 

Elections should be about choosing the person who truly has the people’s best interests at heart – not who has the richest friends and the most vicious attack ads. 

Help me shine a light on dark money and tell outside spending groups to keep out of Montana! 

Click here to sign the petition to tell Congress to pass the DISCLOSE Act right now and keep dark money out of our elections. 

It’s time to bring accountability back to Washington, and with your help I know we can do it. 

Thanks, 

John

Walsh for Montana 

Friends, 

Special interest groups with deep pockets have been buying political power in Washington – and now it’s really hitting home. 

American Crossroads plans to spend $1.7 million on ads against me this fall – and that’s on top of everything they’ve already spent attacking my record of service. 

We have to put a stop to it and the first step is to shine a light on the dark money special interests that are funding these ad campaigns. 

Here’s how we stop this: Congress must pass the DISCLOSE Act – a bill that will require Super PACs to tell us where their money is coming from. 

Our only chance of passing this before it’s too late is if we turn up the heat on Congress. Will you add your name and help shine a light on our elections? 

Click here to tell Congress to pass the DISCLOSE Act to bring accountability back to Washington! 

Stand with John: Urge Congress to pass the DISCLOSE Act! Add your name.

Outside groups who don’t know anything about what’s important to Montanans are trying to buy elections in our state, and it’s time for us to do something about it. 

They know if Congressman Steve Daines wins he’ll continue to protect millionaires, and they’ll do anything they can to make that happen. My opponent has accepted thousands of dollars in donations from the Citizens United Super PAC, so we know exactly where his priorities are. 

If we pass the DISCLOSE Act, we’ll finally put an end to the
