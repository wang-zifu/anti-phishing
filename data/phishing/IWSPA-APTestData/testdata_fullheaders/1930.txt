FW: domain.com - A successful acquisition of Time Warner would provide both riches and risks for Fox

Following our discussion yesterday, here is the article from the Journal stating that a combined Fox/Time Warner would have 40% of US affiliate fees.  There is no suggestion that the new entity would need to sell down to get past the regulators (beyond the talk about CNN), but it still seems like a real possibility.  Perhaps an opportunity for us.




Beyond this there is a general expectation for more consolidation among other networks.  Discovery, Scripps, AMC and domain.com were all trading up by late in the week.
