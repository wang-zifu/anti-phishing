Hi John:

Can in e included in at least one meeting with you and senior managers in ch
arge of crisis management re emails? Someone needs to interface with lawyers
 - who I suspect may be influencing strategy? On my honor I give you my word
 I will not mention to anyone my involvement.

I would also like to talk to my friend the about where to go from here. I ca
n meet her on the road wherever she is. Her husband and I have talked at tim
es - but I haven't given her my views on this email issue can be handled bet
ter going forward.

Of course happy to give you my views too personally. As always. You know sin
ce my education from 1996-98 working with you I have spent most of my time a
s attorney bridging the gap (sometimes large) between legal and political/me
dia perspectives. I am guessing that the former has prevailed on this emails
 issue for a long time. Maybe I am wrong.

Appreciate your consideration. I try not to bother you or try to offer advic
e but rarely. (You of all people know me and know how hard that is for me.  M
y DNA makes it tough. Ask your great fan and former student, Carolyn Atwell-
Davis!)

Warn regards,

Lanny
