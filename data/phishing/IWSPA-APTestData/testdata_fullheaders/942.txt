John,

Did you see Joe last night? Amazing=2E He didn't let Paul Ryan get away
 with anything=2E

Like the Vice President said: Facts matter=2E But with Karl Rove, Grove
r Norquist, and the entire right wing lined up to smear my record, I ne
ed to raise another $7,453 by midnight tonight to get new ads up on TV 
and set the record straight=2E

With 25 days left, we have to hurry before their lies take hold=2E

If you liked what you saw last night, rush $20 or more before our midni
ght deadline to help us do the same thing here in New York=2E
