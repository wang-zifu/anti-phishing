Article: Snapchat's Evan Spiegel And The Antics Of A 23-year-old Novice

Evan, I don't know you well other than our one meeting but this story is total BS from my perspective. I am cc'ing Michael as he like me , will I am sure, tell you to ignore this kind of idiocy as it means nothing.

That said; if you ever do grant another interview let me know as I would be happy to give them my perspective which is; that you and Bobby have a company around innovative product, far more relevant and important to a generation of people who love self-expression of real and meaningful moments rather than phony show-off crap that gets published on Facebook.

Net net, this reminds me of the constant media BS we dealt with at Twitter. The only answer I know is to forget about it and move on.

Best,

Jerry
