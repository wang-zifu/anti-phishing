			Dear Investor,



				Every once in a while a ridiculous deal presents itself.
				IRMGF
				(or inspiration miniing corporation) is a junior miining company
				that has properties in Ontario, Utah and Chile and has just
				found massive reserves of nickel, copper platinum and other rare
				metals. Walstreet is about to start buying up shares in 
				IRMGF
				this very quickly as it is so cheap right now trading at just
				under 10cents. I expect to see this hit a dollar next week. Move
				quickly.
