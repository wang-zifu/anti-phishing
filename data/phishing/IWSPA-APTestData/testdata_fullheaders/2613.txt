Highlights:***

1.     ABC: Pfotenhauer Says McCain was "Exonerated" from Keaton 5, Happy t
o
Talk about the Economy

PFOTENHAUER: McCain was actually exonerated=85 but let's talk about the
economy because that's what we talk about =BE to 2/3 of the time.

2.     CNN: Pfotenhauer Attacks: McCain's Real Focus is the Economy but
Americans Need to Know that Obama is Misrepresenting Himself

PFOTENHAUER: 2/3 to =BE of every speech that.. McCain and Governor Palin ma
ke
are focused on... the economy=85 However=85 Barack Obama frankly misreprese
nts
some of his associations=85 he misrepresents these associations the same wa
y
he misrepresents his record.

3.     CBS: Pfotenhauer attempts to get focus off of the economy and onto
Obama's ties to Bill Ayers

CBS: Pfotenhauer attempts to get focus off of the economy and onto Obama's
ties to Bill Ayers

GIBBS: I'm not sure in the several minutes that you just heard from Nancy
that you got any sort of answer.

4.     FNC: Pfotenhauer Continues Spewing the Morning's Talking Points

PFOTENHAUER: John McCain was exonerated=85 we think Barack Obama has a very
scant record and misrepresents his positions and his associations.

5.     FNC: Sean Hannity Ties Housing Crisis to Obama and ACORN (Sunday
10/05/08)

HANNITY: the economic crisis facing the nation is due in large part to this
disastrous decision by financial institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to
buy up risky loans from small banks but it's groups like ACORN that forced
those banks to give out those loans in the first place.

*Highlight #1*

*Pfotenhauer Says McCain Campaign Not Hesitant to Talk about the
Economy*(ABC 10/06/08 07:15am)

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: As you pointed out Diane, Senator* McCain was actually
exonerated* by the Senate and the democratic council at the time said he ha
d
recommended both John McCain and John Glenn be dropped from the initial
complaint and the Democrats wouldn't do it because then it would be only
democrats who were targeted. *But let's talk about the economy because
that's what we talk about =BE to 2/3 of the time.*

[=85] we're going to go from stopping the hemorrhaging to  how to get the
economy back on track to built jobs, create jobs, create the right
environment for Americans to do better. But we had to first stop the
hemorrhaging and I think our campaign put a lot more on the line, frankly,
to try to solve that problem than Senator Obama who tried to phone it in.
And so we're focused on John McCain's plan to keep taxes low, keep spending
down, and to open up foreign markets for our goods and that's a right
recipe, it's a recipe for success=85

[=85] Senator McCain has built his career doing what's right for the countr
y
rather than what's politically expedient and that's the opposite of Senator
Obama.

*Highlight #2*

*Pfotenhauer Attacks: McCain's Real Focus is the Economy but Americans Need
to Know that Obama is Misrepresenting Himself* (CNN 10/06/08 07:40am)

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: Most people, most Americans, wouldn't do that. They woul
d
think it was bizarre to hang out with someone who basically engaged in
terrorist acts aimed against the American people=85 and I think most Americ
ans
would question the judgment of someone who thinks it's ok to have a
political event at this man's house, serve on a six person board with him

[=85]

PFOTENHAUER: he was 34 years old, he certainly should have been aware of it
.
And this is that very, um exclusive Hyde Park Chicago neighborhood, that's 
a
shocking kind of spin, I can't believe that they're asserting that=85

[=85] If he didn't know who he was hanging out with that's maybe a bigger
problem.

[=85]

KIRAN CHETRY: Why are we talking out this right now when the economy is in
the uh, in a very bad way?

[=85]

PFOTENHAUER: Oh, certain, first of all we talk about the challenges facing
this country every single day in fact I was saying 2/3 to =BE of every spee
ch
that I believe Senator McCain and Governor Palin make are focused on how we
,
how we turn the economy around, how we start creating jobs. So most of our
attention is focused on that. However, we're four weeks away from Americans
pulling the lever on who will be the next commander in chief and Barack
Obama frankly misrepresents some of his associations=85 he misrepresents th
ese
associations the same way he misrepresents his record on issues, whether
it's raising taxes, increasing spending, second amendment issues, public
financing.

[=85] What [Palin] is saying is that he doesn't see America the way middle
Americans do, or middle class Americans do=85

*Highlight #3*

*Pfotenhauer attempts to get focus off of the economy and onto Obama's ties
to Bill Ayers *(CBS, 10/06/08, 7:08am)

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: With Barack Obama we know very little about this man, he
has a very scant record and he frankly =85 hides that record quite frequent
ly
on domestic issues particularly, I could tick through a number but, campaig
n
financing, second amendment issues, taxes spending.  He's got, I think, ver
y
questionable judgment on foreign issues and he's got these relationships
with individuals that I think call into question his judgment and again he
downplays them and ties to kind of push them away.

ROBERT GIBBS: *It's surprising to hear Nancy talk about issues*=85

PFOTENHAUER: I just want to point out that we didn't dredge this informatio
n
up.  The New York Times spent 2,000 words on an article about it the other
day, The Wall Street-

HARRYSMITH: Excuse me what was the, what was the conclusion of that article
?

PFOTENHAUER: The article also concluded is that if Senator McCain had hung
out with somebody who had bombed abortion clinics no one would consider it
illegitimate=85

GIBBS: *I'm not sure in the several minutes that you just heard from Nancy
that you got any sort of answer*.  But the article said they knew each othe
r
but of course they weren't close.  Bill Ayers has played no part in Barack
Obama's campaign.  [CBS Early Show, 10-06-08]

*Highlight #4*

*Pfotenhauer Continues Spewing the Morning's Talking Points* (FNC 10/06/08
08:30am)

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: *John McCain was exonerated*=85 we feel like it's our du
ty
over the next four weeks to shine a light on the differences between these
two men, Americans are gonna walk in that voting booth and pull the lever
for the next president of the United States, who is commander in chief of
our military=85 *we think Barack Obama has a very scant record and
misrepresents his positions and his associations*=85 I know that we'll spen
d
most of our time, as we have during the vast length of time of this campaig
n
=96 it seems endless sometimes =96 talking about our plans for improving th
e
American economy, for keeping this country safe

[=85] most Americans don't view hanging out with a former terrorist as
something that can be overlooked, it s not something any of us would really
do

*Highlight #5*

*Sean Hannity Ties Housing Crisis to Obama and ACORN *(FNC 10/05/08 09:51pm
)

SEAN HANNITY: But ACORN's dirty dealings go beyond just voter fraud, back i
n
the 1990s they used strong-armed tactics to force banks to give high-risk
loans to low-income borrowers with bad domain.com.

[=85] Obama's connections to this radical group began years ago when he fir
st
became a community organizer and caught the eye of ACORN head, Madeline
Talbot, who asked him to train her personal staff=85 in some of their early
election law cases, ACORN's attorney was, well you guessed it, Barack Obama
=85
why has Barack Obama glossed over the work that he did for them? While Obam
a
may not have physically participated in their obvious scare tactics, but
that doesn't mean that he wasn't involved.

[=85] *the economic crisis facing the nation is due in large part to this
disastrous decision by financial institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to
buy up risky loans from small banks but it's groups like ACORN that forced
those banks to give out those loans in the first place.*
