Amy,

I left word for you earlier after getting off the phone with Ari. First let me say that Scott shouldn't have gotten upset that you didn't domain.com him in New York. That sounds a little crazy to me. I'm sorry that the people I work with can be so difficult to work with sometimes. The tradeoff is that Scott is, for me, a fantastic script editor, he gets the movie made at a comfortable number and then sees to it that there's a robust and sophisticated marketing campaign. especially if the movie's in the conversation during awards season.

David. I'm pretty sure he's the best director for this but I know he's not the only director for this. This movie should be a great experience for you. The last thing I want is for you to throw your hands up during the process. This movie isn't an easy yes, it's not Spiderman, and you should be treated by everyone involved as our queen. If that's not possible with David then let's move on.

But one way or another, let's move. David's free right now. Damon's free right now (I don't know if he'd be your choice or not, I'm just saying.) 

When you get a second call me if you can so I can apologize for Scott in person. You're my hero.

Aaron
