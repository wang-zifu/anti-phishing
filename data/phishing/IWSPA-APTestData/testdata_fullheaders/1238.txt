Dear John:

I would greatly appreciate if you could support my appointment as an at lar
ge member of the Democratic Convention Platform.  You may not remember that
 I served as a Organizationmember from Maryland for three terms - from 1980-1992 - 
and a member of the OrganizationExecutive Committee during my last term.  I also kn
ow Deborah Wasserman Schultz well.  I believe there are available "at large
" slots on the committee that are "at large" (i.e., capable of being filled
 by the putative nominee).

I would like some role at the convention and I was involved with various pl
atform committee staff assignments during the Kennedy and Dukakis campaigns
 and thought this would be a good slot for me, in a position to reflect HRC
's and the campaign's positions on core platform issues.  But if you have a
ny other ideas for a convention role, I sure would appreciate it.

Thanks for all your amazing work for HRC - I know there have been huge chal
lenges and the road will be difficult, at least for the short term, but I h
ave no doubt as to the outcome, for the nomination as well as the general, 
and the role you have played in making it all possible.

Carolyn and I will be in Iowa the last weekend through Monday night - knock
ing on doors and helping  out with assigned caucuses.  My close friend Bonn
ie Campbell, former Ia AG and longtime Hillary friend/supporter, is hosting
 us for the weekend. Maybe our paths will cross.

Best wishes,

Lanny
