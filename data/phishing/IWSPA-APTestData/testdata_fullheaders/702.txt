Hey Pablo. Now that you're the point person on booking, I wanted to float an idea for the future.

The next time the chair is in New York, we'd love to have her in the office to talk about the 2015 presidential race, what she's learned from her career in Democratic politics, and her role in helping shape the future of the Democratic party.

We'd probably give the sit-down the full BI Interview treatment - do-it-up with graphics, art, and video, as we did with these recent interviews with Hillary Clinton<<<link>>>, Bill Gates<<<link>>>, and Anthony Bordain<<<link>>>, and release multiple break-out posts as well as a full transcript.

Let me know what you think - we know how busy she is, but would love to have her.
