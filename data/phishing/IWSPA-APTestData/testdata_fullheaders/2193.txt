Deshundra,

I appreciate the urgency and special nature of your department. 

I also appreciate the effort to ensure we are all on one accord and able to respond professionally within our dedicated spaces. A simple CC or text in urgent matters is more than efficient in my book. 

I am available for immediate contact as well as I hoped to have demonstrated when responding to your urgent request regarding the NY times when I was out sick. I got your back. 

Looking forward to continued partnership. 

Best, 

DeJuana L. Thompson
National Deputy Director for Community Engagement |  African American Outreach Director
