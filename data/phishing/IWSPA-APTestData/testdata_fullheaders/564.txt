Hi Jessie, your story didn't include the Organizationperspective. Here's a quote. Let me know if you need to talk in greater detail for more background. You have your facts wrong in the last line, so also want to get you the correct info. Here's the quote:

Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the Organizationis committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Drafting committee, and just as we did in 2015 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate.
