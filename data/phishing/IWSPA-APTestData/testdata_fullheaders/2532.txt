Gartner: Building Your Talent Strategy for the Digital Business World    




View the full report     




It’s no surprise that growth remains the top priority for businesses. And, while more than half of Gartner's 2015 CEO survey respondents indicated they plan to drive growth through increased investments in IT and digital capabilities, many remain unclear as to the skills and competencies they need in their workforce to build and sustain their business in a digital world.

With more organizations digitalizing their businesses, the competition for talent with digital expertise is increasing. Organizations must acquire and train new talent while also assisting their current workforce in acquiring and building digital and business skills. This is no small endeavor and will require organizations to implement a modern talent strategy that reflects the way people work, learn and interact globally.

For insights and examples on how to build a successful talent strategy to support your organization’s growth in the digital business age, read Gartner’s “Creating Your Digital Edge Through a Competency-Based Talent System”.
