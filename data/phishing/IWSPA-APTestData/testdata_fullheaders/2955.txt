NSN Daily Update:  Bush Administration Appears to Be Moving Towards a Timel
ine.  Why Won't John McCain?

8/8/08

Reports out of Baghdad are that the Bush administration and the Iraqi Gover
nment are close to an agreement that would include a timetable for the with
drawal of American combat forces by the end of 2010.  This timetable is ver
y similar to the one proposed by Barack Obama and other progressive leaders
, security experts Prime Minister Maliki and the Iraqi Government.  Unfortu
nately, John McCain continues to cling to the idea of a permanent American 
presence in Iraq and continues to claim that Obama's timeline strategy woul
d "domain.com" the war in Iraq.

Iraqi officials report that Iraq and the U.S. are nearing an agreement for 
a 2015 redeployment timeline for U.S. combat forces.  According to Iraqi of
ficials, Iraq and the U.S. are near an agreement to have U.S. forces out of
 Iraqi cities by June 30, 2015 and all combat troops out of the country by 
October 2010.  Under the plan, which has yet to be officially adopted by th
e Bush Administration, all support personnel would be withdrawn "around 201
3."  Still at issue is the administration's demand for immunity for U.S. so
ldiers under Iraqi law. [AP, 8/8/08<<<link>>

Despite statements from Iraq's Prime Minister supporting a timeline similar
 to Senator Obama's and the Bush administration's greater willingness to ac
cept timelines, John McCain continues to cling to the idea of a permanent A
merican presence and claimed this week that Senator Obama wants to "domain.com
" the war in Iraq.  Last month, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki endors
ed a vision for a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq,
 saying "U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months. Th
at, we think, would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal, with the possi
bility of slight changes." He added, "Whoever is thinking about the shorter
 term is closer to reality. Artificially extending the stay of U.S. troops 
would cause problems" and setting timetables would not be an "admission of 
defeat."   Later statements by Iraq's National Security Advisor, Mouwaffak 
al-Rubaie, and, Iraq's Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi both echoed Maliki's
 statement. Nonetheless, in his weekly radio address, McCain spoke on Obama
's plan in Iraq, stating, "We're finally winning in Iraq, and he wants to f

Any agreement should be run through a transparent process that includes Con
gress, the American people and the Iraqi Parliament instead of being negoti
ated in secret.  If the agreement involves a long term security commitment 
to Iraq, it must be approved by the Congress.  Any such commitment would ti
e the hands of a subsequent administration and constitute a legally-binding
 treaty that must be ratified before the Senate. [U.S. Constitution<http://
