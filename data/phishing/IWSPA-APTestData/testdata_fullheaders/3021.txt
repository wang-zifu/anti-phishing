Remembering Paul Walker  

 <<link>>   Special iPad Tribute     * PAUL WALKER'S MOVIE CAREER:
From 'Pleasantville,' his first major film, to 'She's All That,' 'Flags of Our Fathers' and the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, the actor's career is remembered in photos. Plus, haunting portraits from an exclusive THR photo shoot and exclusive video of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and their 'Fast & Furious' castmates. 

* WHAT KILLED HIM? The latest on the investigation into the tragic accident that cut short Paul Walker's life, the eyebrow-raising history of the "Bat domain.com crazy car" in which Walker died and the thorny issues Universal Pictures and its insurer are grappling with as they try to figure out how to move forward with 'Fast & Furious 7.'

* A HEARTFELT, PERSONAL REMEMBERANCE: By filmmaker Gary Ross, who cast a 23-year-old Walker as a high school hunk whose world is rocked in 'Pleasantville.'
