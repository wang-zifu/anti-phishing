Yep, this is coordinated with Kevin and David.

These are our coordinated ideas for your decision.  They are heavily
pressuring for a answer tomorrow AM if not tonight.

1.  Keep it in DC or VA.  Schaitberger will call a special board meeting
and the endorsement event will immediately follow.  They wanted August 24,
although the scheduling sounds like it won't work on our end.

2.  Option to host board meeting/endorsement event in early state.  If you
want this option (which I strongly favor) Robby needs to call HAS one more
time and propose.  It's teed up for him to say yes.

My opinion, I think Iowa would be best.  It gives our IA team a labor bump
when they've been struggling with labor/trade/Bernie.  It would be done
well and would be good messaging.

If possible tonight, could I get consensus that Iowa is the way we'd like
to go, Robby will be calling HAS and the DC date of August 24 is now off
the books?  We can schedule the Iowa date a later time.

The IAFF is trying to be helpful and are very anxious to get back to Harold
with our decision.

What do you think?  Appreciate and apologize for the rush.
Nikki
