Rory,




Do you think it appropriate for me to attend a couple of the exhibitor meetings you have at CinemaCon?  




In particular, if you think it OK, I’d like to join you for:




·         UCI Odeon on Monday at 9:30—Drew Kaza may be attending the schedule says and they are pretty active on the new technology front.

·         AMC on Wed morning at 8:30
