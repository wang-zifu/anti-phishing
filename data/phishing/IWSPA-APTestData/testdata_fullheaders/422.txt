sent to soon, apologies

2 other things i have heard lately are the ubs paid speech being 150 and th
e rockefeller issue

i would make the same decision on rockefeller every day of the week
as for ubs, for ex, wjc did a speech for vernon last week for 50k
he does walker speeches for a wide range of fees and the ubs deal i made wa
s 6 speeches for 150
3 in 2015 which he has done and 3 in 2015 which he can do
regardless, he signs off on them all and we could care a less if he does th
em or not
