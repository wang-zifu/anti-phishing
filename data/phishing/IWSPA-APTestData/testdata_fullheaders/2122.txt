the GOP and Romney making Mayor Brown's race into a national referendum aga

They fear Alvin as mayor can help deliver Florida in 2015 for Hillary--and 
they are right!

Please share with Hillary and the Campaign.

Mitt Romney Hits the First Coast for Lenny Curry and Jacksonville domain.com

Alvin Brown, Mitt Romney, and Lenny CurryHide
The First Coast is on former Gov. Mitt Romney's, R-Mass., mind this week as
 he gets involved in the Jacksonville mayoral race and receives an honorary
 degree from Jacksonville University (JU).

On Tuesday, Romney endorsed former Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) Chair
man Lenny Curry in the runoff next month against Jacksonville Mayor Alvin B
rown. Curry led the RPOF in the 2015 elections when Romney was the Republic
an candidate against President Barack Obama.
=93I have traveled our country working to advance conservative principles, 
and here in Florida I=92ve had a partner in Lenny Curry,=94 Romney said on 
Tuesday. =93Lenny is committed to restoring conservative leadership to Jack
sonville. As an accountant and business owner, his professional experiences
 make him the right person to deal with the city=92s finances. Lenny and hi
s wife Molly have dedicated themselves to making Jacksonville a better plac
e for their children and all families. I proudly support Lenny Curry, and a
sk all of Jacksonville to vote Lenny Curry for mayor.=94
=93Mitt Romney is a conservative leader with a passion to see America succe
ed,=94 Curry said. =93In business and in public service, Gov. Romney has be
en a tireless advocate for freedom and prosperity. I am honored to have his
 support and endorsement, and I thank him for taking time to remind voters 
that conservative principles are the pathway to a better Jacksonville.=94
Romney will be the headliner for a fundraiser for Curry on Friday. Leading 
Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., a possible U.S. Sena
te candidate in 2016; former Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford; former
 Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton and businessman Wayne Weaver, who brought t
he National Football League (NFL) to the First Coast as the first owner of 
the Jacksonville Jaguars, are also hosting the fundraiser.
The Curry team also sent out a fundraising email from Romney this week in w
hich the former presidential candidate connected Brown to national Democrat
s including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the favorite fo
r her party=92s presidential nomination next year. Brown is the first Democ
rat to hold the mayoral office since Ed Austin who was elected in 1991.
Brown=92s team struck back as Yianni Varonis, a spokesman for the Jacksonvi
lle Democrat, went on the attack when he talked to the Florida Times-Union.

"It's little surprise that a candidate who was infamous for being out of to
uch with working families would stump for the equally out of touch Lenny Cu
rry," Varonis told the Times-Union. "While Mayor Brown has spent four years
 working across the aisle to create 36,000 new jobs and not raise taxes, Le
nny Curry has opposed all efforts to close the gender wage gap and other me
asures that would create economic opportunity for all Jacksonville citizens
 -- and not just the richest few."
Romney, who announced earlier this year that he would not make another try 
at the presidency, will give the commencement address and receive an honora
ry degree at JU's graduation ceremony on Saturday. Over the years, JU has f
ocused on bringing political leaders to the First Coast, including Presiden
t Gerald Ford after his White House tenure, President Lyndon Johnson during
 his days as John F. Kennedy=92s vice president, U.S. Secretaries of State 
Dean Rusk and Colin Powell and third-party presidential hopeful Ross Perot.
