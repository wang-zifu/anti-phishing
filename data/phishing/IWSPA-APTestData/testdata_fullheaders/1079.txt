Hey -

I know Chris reached out, but I wanted to follow up. We're still $6,213 
from our fundraising goal with 79,586 voters left to talk to all over the 
Hudson Valley. With the polls this close (one has us LITERALLY TIED), we 
can't afford to have even ONE person stay home, and talking to them all 
takes a lot of resources. Please give, or we will lose:

Thanks,

Sean
