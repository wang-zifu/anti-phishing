  Missing Work - History

  Hi Mallory -
We are a month into the school year and there are a number of items you have not completed.  As it stands they are in the grade book as zeroes, which has a serious impact on your grade.
You never submitted a map for domain.com 1, as well as the take home/open notes quiz which was due over 2 weeks ago on Wednesday 9/3.  I have mentioned this to you in person as well as sent a Canvas message, but have since received no reply.  The practice current event is also still missing and this was due last Tuesday 9/9. 

At this point I am concerned about this trend and want to see what I can do to help you stop this domain.com before it is too late to repair the damage to your grade.  I want to be able to give you domain.com, but I can't do that if you haven't completed any of the work.  Please check in with me so we can figure out a plan for going forward this semester.

Miss Weiss
