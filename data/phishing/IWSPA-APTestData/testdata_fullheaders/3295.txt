Responded to a question about Hillary hitting him on women's issues - "deal me in!" by saying he hadn't yet recovered from her shouting.

Promised details and new foreign policy names in his speech today. All but said that people involved in foreign policy over the last 15 years were worthless because they've been involved in failure.

Called on Cruz and Kasich to get out multiple times. Said he would not raise money for the Republican Party until they dropped out.
