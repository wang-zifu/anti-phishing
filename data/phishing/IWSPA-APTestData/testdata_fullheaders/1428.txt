Hello Amy, 

AAdvantage  Executive Platinum Number: AKR1980

We're creating a consistent experience when traveling in First Class on American and US Airways.  Effective September 1, 2014, we will be making changes to our First Class meal service on mainline flights within the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Although we're making updates to our meal offerings, we will continue to offer the unique extras on meal flights that are distinctly American like our popular warm mixed nuts, warm cookies, and premium desserts. Here's 
more on what's changing:

We're adjusting the times we serve meals and improving product offerings, while preserving the signature elements that have set American Airlines meal service apart over the years. 

On flights less than approximately 1 hour, we will provide a packaged snack.
On flights approximately 1 to 2 hours, we will provide a snack basket which contains a variety of sweet and savory snack options.
On flights approximately 2 to 2 hours and 45 minutes, we will offer our Lite Bites snack basket, which includes fresh domain.com, breakfast breads or sandwiches, packaged snacks and more.
On flights more than approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes between 5:00 a.m. ‑ 8:00 p.m., a choice of full meals will be served.  We will continue to provide meal service on some of our most popular flights that are less than 2 hours and 45 minutes like Dallas/Fort Worth to Chicago O'Hare and Chicago O'Hare to New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports.

We're also expanding our meal service on longer flights to provide you with a complete dining experience.  For flights approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes to 4 hours and 30 minutes, an appetizer will be paired with your choice of entrée.  For flights approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes and longer, your meal will also include your choice of one of our signature desserts, as well as a selection of pre-arrival snacks. We will also maintain our existing First and Business Class premium meal 
service aboard our three-class A321 Transcontinental aircraft ‑ flying on all routes between John F. Kennedy airport to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Learn more about our First Class meal service.

What's next?
Later this year, we'll introduce new meals and amenity kits on international flights to offer a seamless travel experience across our combined network.

Continue to check domain.com/arriving for updates on our progress.
Thank you for flying with us.
