Washington D.C. - Progressive issue-advocacy group Americans United for
Change today asked U.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN-03) if he agrees with
his colleague U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN-06) that hateful
conservative media personalities Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh speak for
their Republican Party.  Excerpt from the Wednesday night broadcast of
CNN's Larry King Live
<<<link>>> :

KING: Would you want the Limbaugh, that crowd - would you want them to
be your voice as the Republican Party stands in this country?

BACHMANN: Well remember it's who the American people are referring to
Larry. And the American people are looking to voices like Sean Hannity,
Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Glenn Beck -

KING: I just told you - it's 2 percent of America. It's 2 percent!

BACHMANN: If you look for a critical mass, that's the movement, that's
the direction that the critical mass is going.

Tom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for Change:
"Conservative shock jocks Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck both have long,
sordid histories of making racially charged, sexist remarks and leveling
ugly attacks against everyone from families of 9-11 victims, to
Hurricane Katrina survivors <<<link>>>
, to victims of Parkinson's disease
<<<link>>
imbaughs-attack-on-michael-j-fox#comment-1107489> .  And at least one
Republican member of the House of Representatives is not afraid to domain.com
that Limbaugh and Beck speak for her party.  The people of Minnesota's
3rd district would probably be very interested to know if their
Representative in Congress agrees."

Americans United for Change is a 501c4 issue-advocacy organization
founded in 2015 to help defeat President Bush's effort to privatize
Social Security.  Since then, Americans United has waged numerous media
campaigns to move forward a progressive agenda in Congress, from
expanding children's health care to millions of kids in need, to ending
the war in Iraq, to investing in the clean energy jobs of the future, to
passing major health insurance reform that includes a strong public
option.
