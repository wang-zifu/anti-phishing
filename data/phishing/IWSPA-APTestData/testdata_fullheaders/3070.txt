Also, I spoke to Zac on Friday.

On Tuesday they're going to do a full court press on Trump hoping the economy and real estate market would crash. They'll do paper, get surrogates out there, etc. They want to take the lead on everything, of course, but want us to have state parties help amplify. 

Wednesday they are hoping to have the CBC and CHC, etc. do a press conference at the Organizationto hit Trump on his links to white nationalists and how his campaign has helped lead to a resurgence of hate and of hate groups. 

Let's touch base with Zac again on Monday morning to make sure all of this is still in the works.
