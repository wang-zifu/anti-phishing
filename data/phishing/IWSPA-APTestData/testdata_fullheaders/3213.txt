THINK LIKE A MAN TOO - SCREENING COMMENTS

Dear Nigel,




For my territories, where the original worked very well in some cases, I don’t see any reason why we can’t repeat the same level of business which would be $2.5m which was 55% of International.




South Africa was the highest grossing territory worldwide with $1.3m. The book was very popular. About Last Night has also grossed more than Ride Along down there domain.com only $400,000. The fact that TLAM2T has less sexual references makes this ideal for the broader SAF audience. We currently have a 6/20 date there which we are trying to work out with a better date for Jump St but still intend to be within a month of the US.




Nigeria and Kenya both look good and grossed $380,000 with their associated territories last time around.




Middle East will be better than ALN because of less sexual humour but we were banned in domain.com, Qatar and Jordan last time. TLAM in UAE grossed $430,000 and the region in total made $725,000.




We have done nicely with ALN in Romania as well recently after Ride Along did good business so happy for them to step forward on this one too. ALN has grossed $150,000 which is great business for an Eastern European market. The less sexual humour might not be as much of an advantage here but it will be a relatively risk-free release which we can learn from.




That would probably be about it for those worth releasing at this stage.




We will have to do a token Scandi TV qualifier and that fell to Denmark last time around so will look to repeat that..




Thanks,

Mark
