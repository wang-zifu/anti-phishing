Lib dem proposal - 1% annual tax on value of property over ?2million - threshold to rise with average house prices.

Might be part of their negotiating position if they are part of new coalition next year...

I would be surprised if something like this ever went through but I wouldn't be surprised if council tax bands were extended and values recalculated...
