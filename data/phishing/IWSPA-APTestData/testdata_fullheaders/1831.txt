David,
I think I have to pass.  I'm drowning.

rote:

o the closing remarks (at about 5 pm) for a conference the law center is hol
ding to celebrate the  40th Anniversary of the Privacy Act and the =E2=80=99
74 Amendments to FOIA.   The conference will be held on Oct. 30, a Thursday.
  The last panel will focus on the future of information regulation in the U
S, and there is no one better to sum up where the Administration would like t
o see information policy develop then you.  This would not be heavy lifting.
  You=E2=80=99d have 15 or 20 minutes, and my thought is that you could summ
arize the big data recommendations in a few minutes, and then turn to the Ad
ministration=E2=80=99s interest in moving FOIA from a requester-driven statu
te to one where the government itself makes information public without the f
ormality of a request.  It would be great for the law school if you could pa
rticipate.  Thanks for considering this.  All my best, David
