t r u t h o u t | Being supported almost entirely by our readers makes Truthout unique. It's what gives us the editorial freedom to produce stories you'll never see in mainstream media.  It's why I love working here and it's why over a million people read us each month. 

It also means that we rely on the support of people who are determined to keep independent journalism alive. Many readers have stepped up to join our last fundraising campaign of the year, but we still have to raise $18,000 more in little over a day. If we don't hit our goal by the end of tomorrow, if we take a hit on this, it will deeply hinder our ability to bring you the news and analysis you rely on.

Will you end the year knowing that you made an essential contribution to Truthout's survival? Please donate now if you can!
