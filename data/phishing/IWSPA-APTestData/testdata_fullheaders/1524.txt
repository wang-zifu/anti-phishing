Here is my take on this:

*         There was not enough clarity btw digital and press on what this account would be up front.

*         Twitter is not just an organizing or social media platform - it is a place where news is made.

*         There needs to be an account owned and run by press secretaries.

*         The purpose of the account is to interact with reporters, to quickly respond to things, to land stories...

*         The purpose of this account is NOT to build followers. Which is digital's concern. We are fine having just 500 followers if they are 500 reporters who matter. We DON'T want random people following the account - they should be following the main digital account.

*         Press secretaries should have freedom to use judgment and use the account freely with minimal involvement from digital.

*         If something is a snarky line - no facts involved - what is the point of running thru research?

*         We need to be able to live tweet things.

Happy to share or discuss further but I'm not sure why Cate feels ownership over this account.
