Afternoon,

Just spoke with a member of your team who suggested I send over the following numbers for confirmation.

Out of the open primary contests (caucuses and primaries) Hillary Clinton has won 10/14. And Bernie Sanders has won 4/14

If at all possible, would love confirmation by 4pm. Thanks so much
