A request for a quote from you.. Not sure how to respond? I'm fine saying I
can't get one if that's best, you can let me know.

Hi Meghan,

Autumn (Editor in Chief of PATCH Bay Area) wanted to do a quick article for
World Cancer Awareness Day. Is it possible to get a quote?  Thank you my
friend!!! It means more to me than words can say!

Love, Kerrie

Ha, ha. I don't wanna piss Ellen off! I bet she will come around. I was
going to do something short like:

Headline: President Obama Wears T-Shirt Supporting Dublin Teen Battling
Cancer
Description: He was aboard Air Force One and he was wearing a
#CamilleStrong t-shirt

Body: Work in progress

Would it be okay to say that School Board Member Megan Rouse, whose father
is John user, sent the shirt via her dad.

Could Megan get a quote from her dad for me ASAP?
