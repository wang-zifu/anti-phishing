Hey Chuck, per our conversation earlier today, I'd appreciate it if you passed along the following to the Morning Joe team. I understand Joe and Mika will say whatever they're going to say in terms of opinion, but at a minimum they should consider the facts on some of the key allegations they're making.

The OrganizationChair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it's not her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms<<<link>>> about both of our candidates<<<link>>> and the substantive campaigns they've run<<<link>>>. As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings<<<link>>#.qepssg11f> overall this year than they did in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both campaigns to agree, we added four.

The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for several cycles. In fact, the major change from 2015 - when Obama beat Clinton --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged "super" delegates, now down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules.

The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participation of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that lays out the facts on Super Delegates<<<link>>#.288n079v7>. It also debunks the false myths about Iowa.

The DNC's delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any of these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for several cycles - including 2015 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton.
