Hey, John --

Hope all is well with you.

I just wanted to let you know that if you find yourself in need of some help in the next few months, I would be happy to help out. 

I'm certain that Sen. Bayh would give me a leave of absence, so it would
be an easy thing for me to do. I did the transition in '92 and then, as you know, did all eight years at the WH, except for a few months at the reelect. So, if you need an old hand, let me know. 

I'm not taking a win for granted. There's still lots to do, but it's looking good, even in Indiana.  Who could've imagined that?! 

Take care.
