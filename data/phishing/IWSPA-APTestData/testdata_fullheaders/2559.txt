Subject: Smart take from Matt Lee-Ashley on Jeb's Land Management Plan
From: Milia Fisher <mfisher@hillaryclinton.com>

Here's Matt Lee-Ashley's smart take. Pete sent over.

*Summary:* The Bush plan on land management is more measured than the
statements that several of the other Republican candidates have made about
public lands.  The rhetoric in the plan relies on the well-worn West vs
Washington narrative and, to drive that message, it proposes that the
Department of the Interior be moved to a western state (All but a tiny
fraction of DOI's employees already work outside of DC in 2,400 locations
<<<link>>> across the
country and in the territories).  The plan does not, however, propose an
outright transfer of federal oil, gas, and coal resources to state control
(Rubio), nor does it support the privatization of public lands
(Fiorina).  It instead walks the line on the question of land ownership by
promising that federal agencies will give =E2=80=9Cdeference=E2=80=9D to st
ates,
=E2=80=9Cconsistent with law,=E2=80=9D in deciding land uses on public land
s.

The plan pledges support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, though
it proposes a short-term diversion of its resources to pay for the
maintenance of national parks during the Centennial in 2016.  The plan
hedges on whether Bush would use the Antiquities Act to protect new
national monuments, saying he would launch a dialogue with western leaders
on how to improve the monument designation process. The plan also does not
reject federal land acquisition, noting that acquisitions can help meet
certain conservation objectives, such as protecting access for sportsmen
and buying inholdings in parks.

The areas that progressives and conservationists will find most problematic
are:

   - His pledge to halt what he calls EPA=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98Waters of the 
U.S.=E2=80=99 rule (and
   which we call the Drinking Water Rule).
   - His commitment to accelerate the fast-tracking of new mines, including
   a two-year time domain.com on domain.com approvals.
   -   His promise to increase logging to reduce the risks of wildfires.
   -  His idea of temporarily diverting the Land and Water Conservation
   Fund to pay for backlogged maintenance in national parks =E2=80=93 we sh
ouldn=E2=80=99t be
   raiding the LWCF to pay for costs that Congress should already be fundin
g
   in the normal course of business.

*Soft spots:*

   - Governor Bush=E2=80=99s plan for America=E2=80=99s public lands is str
aight from the
   1980s, offering no new substantive ideas.  His plan can be summarized as
:
   more mining, more drilling, and more logging on America=E2=80=99s public
 lands.
   - Under his plan, western communities would see fewer protections for
   clean drinking water, the disappearance of wildlife habitat with vast ne
w
   mining and drilling operations, and more special breaks for Big Oil and 
Big
   Coal companies.
   - Governor Bush=E2=80=99s plan once again fails to mention the words =E2
=80=9Cclimate
   change.=E2=80=9D You can=E2=80=99t begin to confront the complex challen
ges of drought,
   wildfires, or extreme weather in the West without acknowledging that
   climate change is real and by taking action to confront it.
   - We shouldn=E2=80=99t be settling for the status quo when it comes to
   recreational access on America=E2=80=99s public lands =E2=80=93 we shoul
d be expanding
   access for hunters, anglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts.  There are
   approximately 4 million acres
   <<<link>>
-public-land-access-in-the-west/>of
   public lands in the West that, because of checker-boarding and land
   ownership patterns, are inaccessible to the public.  We should be expand
ing
   access, not settling for =E2=80=98no net loss.=E2=80=99
   - Under Governor Bush=E2=80=99s plan, western communities will continue 
to get
   shortchanged by bargain-basement federal royalty rates on oil, gas, and
   coal.  We need to close loopholes, cut subsidies, and ensure that wester
n
   states and local communities get every dollar they are owed from the
   extraction of fossil fuels on public lands.

*Potential responses:*

*Expanded conservation funding proposal:* Propose a re-launch of the Land
and Water Conservation Fund that uses oil, gas, and coal royalty reform to
provide dedicated funding for a wide range of conservation and sportsmen=E2
=80=99s
access programs.  Such a proposal would highlight the extent to which
Bush=E2=80=99s conservation ideas are status quo.

*Articulate a contrast with the extreme =E2=80=98land grab=E2=80=99 compone
nts of
Republican plans: *Rubio, Cruz, and Fiorina are among the candidates who
are supporting the transfer or privatization of America=E2=80=99s public la
nds.  A
pledge to defend America=E2=80=99s public lands from being sold off or give
n away
(=E2=80=9Ckeep it public=E2=80=9D) would be well received and draw a deep c
ontrast with
Republican candidates.
