Carson on MTP Daily

Role in VP selection

-          Only involved to save the next generation

-          Next move will be by Trump

How many names?

-          I'll let him say

-          Refutes WaPo story

Vetting process? Asking for tax returns?

-          Philosophical alignment with candidate

-          Understands fiscal responsibility

-          Normal vetting process is underway

I assume that means tax returns?

-          Normal process
