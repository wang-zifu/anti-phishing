LCV Statement on John user & Brian Deese

WASHINGTON, DC - League of Conservation Voters (LCV) President Gene Karpins
ki released this statement following the news that White House senior advis
er John user will be leaving the Obama administration and will be succee
ded by Brian Deese, Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget:

"John user has been critically important to the unprecedented progress t
he Obama administration has made in addressing the climate crisis. From the
 Clean Power Plan to the historic emissions agreement with China to the adm
inistration's aggressive stance against climate science deniers, John's inf
luence and leadership is clear. He has also been instrumental in protecting
 treasured lands as national monuments. There's no doubt that he'll remain 
deeply committed to the cause in the years ahead. Brian Deese is a fantasti
c choice to build on John's incredible leadership and to keep climate chang
e at the top of the President's agenda. We look forward to working with Bri
an as President Obama continues to build on his far-reaching climate change
 legacy."
