John --

In the last two years, it's been supporters like you who've redefined what 
it means to be a Democrat.

There's a renewed commitment toward organizing -- which you helped instill 
with the campaign in 2008. That's why Democrats have launched the most 
ambitious voter-turnout effort we've ever seen for an election like the 
one this fall.

There's a renewed commitment toward taking on the special interests and 
opposing their agenda -- a promise you've helped us keep time and time 
again. And even though we don't take money from lobbyists or corporate 
PACs, we're still raising more money than the Republicans, month after 
month.

With this renewed focus, the Democrats have introduced a new website 
filled with innovations to better connect supporters with candidates, 
state parties, and each other -- and a new look to match that message.

With just weeks to go in a critical election season, we want to help show 
that moving this country forward is a commitment shared by Americans 
across the states.

So we're giving away thousands of free stickers to help people show their 
support. Can we send you one?

It's what you helped build that laid the groundwork for this new 
commitment for our party. And together, we've spent the last year and a 
half building a new foundation for our country.

Everything Democrats have accomplished -- from reforming a broken health 
care system to reining in the Wall Street banks that were out of control 
-- has been because of you.

It's something to be proud of. And I hope you'll take advantage of this 
opportunity to put that pride on display.

Thanks,

David Plouffe
