Mark,

As I've mentioned to you, Christina Bellantoni from the LA Times and Leon Krauze from Univision would like to interview the Chair while she's out in Los Angeles.

Please let me know what time windows work best for the Chair on May 4th, so I can let them know asap. User has ok'd both of these trips already.

Los Angeles Times
Interviewer: Christina Bellantoni
Where: TBD - she just said that she would love to meet for coffee, so we can work around the Chair's schedule for this
Time: Also TBD

Univision
Interviewer: Leon Krauze
Where: Ideally at the Univision Studios (5999 Center Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045)
Time: Ideally in the later afternoon (after 8 pm)
Note: Leon said they can be flexible and can have the Chair come in earlier in the day
