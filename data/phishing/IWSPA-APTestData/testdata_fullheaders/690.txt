Three cheers for divestment!

<<link>>
 Top McCain Strategist Had Client With Ties To
Tehran<<<link>>>

In the summer of 2005, John McCain's chief strategist Charlie Black, working
for his firm Black, Kelly, Scruggs & Healey, was paid $60,000 to lobby the
U.S. government on behalf of the Chinese oil conglomerate CNOOC. At the
time, CNOOC was mounting an aggressive bid to buy Unocal, a California-based
oil giant, and Black was tasked with churning up congressional support. But
the bid ultimately fell through, in part because of objections over CNOOC's
ties to Iran, a country in which it had already invested tens of millions of
dollars.

"This transaction poses a clear threat to the energy and national security
of the United States," wrote Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican. "U.S.
national energy security depends on sufficient energy supplies to support
U.S. and global economic growth. But those supplies are threatened by
China's aggressive tactics to lock up energy supplies around the world that
are largely dedicated for their own use."

Flash-forward nearly three years and Black's old client -- which later
scored a $16 billion deal with the Iranian government -- could now create
major headaches for his current boss. On Monday, McCain, in a speech at the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, called for a broad and aggressive
international campaign to divest from Iran.

"We should privatize the sanctions against Iran by launching a worldwide
divestment campaign," he said. "As more people, businesses, pension funds,
and financial institutions across the world divest from companies doing
business with Iran, the radical elite who run that country will become even
more unpopular than they are already."

But, as demonstrated by the CNOOC anecdote, if choking off Tehran's economic
lifeblood is McCain's goal, he could have personally started down that road
years ago -- with his own advisers.

Indeed, in addition to Black, McCain employs several other campaign aides
and fundraisers who have served in lobbying capacities in which they
advocated on behalf of foreign clients with investments and interests in
Iran.

As Talking Points Memo
reported<<<link>>>,
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis and his firm, Davis Manafort, "helped
Akhmetov's conglomerate, System Capital Management Holdings, to develop a
'corporate communications strategy' between the beginning of 2015 through
the end of summer 2005... The company's subsidiary, Metinvest, a steel
company, has one of its 11 offices in Tehran. And another subsidiary,
Khartsyzsk Pipe Plant, sells large pipes to Iran."

A bit further removed, one of McCain's fundraisers, Peter Madigan, and
Black's wife Judy, both lobby on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, a
country that AIPAC itself
says<<<link>>>is a major hub
for shipment of illegal goods into Iran. Another McCain
adviser, Carly Fiorina, formerly headed Hewlett Packard, which Forbes
Magazine reported <<<link>>>,
kept offices in Dubai in efforts of facilitating trade with Tehran.

But it's not just economic ties that bind, however tangentially, McCain's
campaign and the Iranian government. There are political connections as
well. One of the controversial figures represented by Black and his firm was
Ahmad Chalabi, the Iraqi dissident who pushed for the invasion of Iraq with
key Pentagon and administration officials before the war and has since,
reportedly, passed U.S. information on Iraq to Iran.

As the New York Times
reported<<<link>>>in
2004, "Chalabi... disclosed to an Iranian official that the United
States
had broken the secret communications code of Iran's intelligence service,
betraying one of Washington's most valuable sources of information about
Iran, according to United States intelligence officials."

Black and Davis, it should be noted, have cut their lobbying ties in
accordance with the McCain campaign's new conflict of interest policy. And
McCain's call for divestment from Iran not only reflects a long held belief
by the Senator but also comes despite these associations.

That aside, the distance between Obama and McCain on the topic of levying
economic sanctions on Iran is not as wide as the Arizona Republican
presents. While Obama did oppose (though not by vote) and McCain supported
an amendment offered by Sens. Kyl and Lieberman that would have, among other
things, designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization,
he did so, his campaign says, out of concern that the language was overtly
inflammatory. In 2007, moreover, Obama sponsored an Iran divestment bill
that he claimed "would educate investors and pressure foreign companies to
reconsider doing business with Iran by requiring the U.S. government to
publish - every six months - a list of companies that invest more than $20
million in Iran's energy sector."

It was Alabama Republican Richard Shelby who held up the measure in the
Senate in what was described by the Israel paper Haarezt, as "a favor" for
the Bush administration. Today, it is still on hold.
