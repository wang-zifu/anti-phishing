								Dear Readers,



One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,
not mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around
for a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these
efforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,
it's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-
replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new heights.
But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these 
things really get so hot that you can press pants with them? 
Executive Editor John Morris sorts it out for you.
