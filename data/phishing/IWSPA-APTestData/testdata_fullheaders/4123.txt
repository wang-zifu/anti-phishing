Question from skaubraatmyra

Hello,
Hi,

I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So, I'm carrying an "icon" where it says "I am a member since less than 30 days".

A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback.

But still, mine's got a "zero" feedback?

Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback.

But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one.

Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?.

Regards, 
 Gretta.

Respond to this question in My Messages. 

Thank you for using eBay
