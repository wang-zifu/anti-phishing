ASM – Great start to our launch of trailer.  Buzz is very strong.  Faith based effort is launched and we are seeding discussion around "choices" and "consequences".  Fan boys are a lock - moving toward female focus 

Jump Street – per my note, we plan to use the best testing trailer despite that it gives up the Dickson joke.  Will be submitting a couple of alternative copy lines to their preferred "It's always worse the second time" (Feel bad movie, anyone?)

Sex Tape – testing a new trailer that uses some of the sexy stuff up front - it may go too far.  Have an alternate to the last version as well that revises the opening that no one liked. 

Equalizer – great testing on final revision.  

Spoke to Seth and Evan and Weaver – Pavlic is on The Interview 

More later
