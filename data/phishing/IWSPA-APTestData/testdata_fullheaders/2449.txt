You are now officially @UserUser=96 your old login information for @Mir
aUserDC should work to get in, and all of your old content is there. I just
 double-checked, and the Twitter account listed on your Medium account auto
matically updated. You=92ll probably have to change others manually though 
(do you list it on LinkedIn?)

We also still have User. I just put up a quick bio directing people 
to your new account, and a black and white version of your Twitter avatar. 
You can make whatever edits there you want, but I would leave something up 
that acknowledges that this used to be you, and redirecting people to the r
ight place.

Password is 14milJOBS!, but you can change it. I would log in once to chang
e the email address to one you own (it=92s currently my gmail).

Let me know if you have questions, but you should be all set.
