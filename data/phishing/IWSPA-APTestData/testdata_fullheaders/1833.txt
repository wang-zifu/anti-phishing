A note from Stephan Wolohojian

I hope you’ve heard the news that the Harvard Art Museums will open to the public on November 16, 2014. Every corner of the new museums is abuzz with activity. Together with my colleagues in the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Arthur M. Sackler museums, I am excited to present our collections in new and thought-provoking ways.

Your support and loyalty have enabled us to realize our vision, and have made this Herculean effort much less daunting. On behalf of everyone at the museums, I thank you for your ongoing and continued support.

I hope you will consider making a donation to the spring appeal to further our ambitious goals for teaching, curatorial excellence, and conservation. This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our institution, and we look forward to sharing the collections with you this fall. 

With sincere thanks and best wishes,
