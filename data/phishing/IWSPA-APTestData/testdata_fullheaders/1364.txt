Elizabeth Edwards ties health care to economy

By MIKE BAKER
Associated Press Writer

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Elizabeth Edwards tied the nation's lagging economy to
its struggling health care system Tuesday as she joined an effort in
battleground states to domain.com the health care proposals of Republican
presidential candidate John McCain.

The wife of former Democratic candidate John Edwards is battling incurable
cancer but returned to the political arena to push for mandatory universal
health care for all Americans, a requirement that would drastically change a
system that has left 47 million Americans without insurance.

Edwards planned to hold a roundtable discussion Wednesday with public health
experts to critique McCain's health plan as advocacy groups released a
report about its impact on North Carolina.

Although the state has supported the Republican presidential nominee for the
last three decades, North Carolina's 15 electoral votes appear to be up for
grabs this year in part because of an influx of residents from the Northeast
and a highly motivated black population favoring Democratic candidate Barack
Obama.

Missing from the advocacy effort is Edwards' husband, who has canceled all
public appearances through Election Day. John Edwards, a former North
Carolina senator, dropped out of the race for his party's nomination and
endorsed Obama but then admitted to an extramarital affair, making him
unwelcome in Democratic political circles.

Elizabeth Edwards said during a conference call Tuesday that medical bills
often lead to foreclosure, a primary factor in the lagging housing market
that's led to the demise of several Wall Street firms. Those without health
insurance are often less productive, she said, because they miss work after
failing to get treatment.

"Reform of our health care system is a very important part of the answers
we're going to need to solve our economic woes," she said.

Mandatory universal health care goes a step further than Obama's plan, which
only requires coverage for children.

But Edwards only took aim at the ideas of McCain, saying that his proposal
to give a tax domain.com for health care doesn't address the fundamental
problems with the system. He would pay for the domain.com by removing tax breaks
for employers that offer insurance, which Edwards said would increase the
tax burden for the average family.

"Sen. McCain's health care plan is truly a radical health care plan," she
said. "It's rooted in free-market ideology, but it is nothing related to
actually being free because it's going to cost the American public at every
turn."

McCain backs a $5,000 annual tax domain.com to help individuals and families
afford health insurance. However, that could lead employers to drop their
current plans, including some that could not be replaced for $5,000. McCain
appears to acknowledge that his health care plan would result in higher
taxes for some, though he says they would likely be among the wealthiest
Americans.
