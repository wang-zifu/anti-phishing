Why Does Hillary Want to Be President, Anyway?
So far it looks like Mrs. Clinton would have at least as many problems in 2
016 as she did in 2008.
By KARL ROVE
Dec. 10, 2015 
The Wall Street Journal

There have generally been two reactions to former Secretary of State Hillar
y Clinton 's Dec. 3 statement at Georgetown University that America should 
try to "empathize" with our nation's "enemies."

One camp holds that Mrs. Clinton simply chose the wrong word to express a b
anal thought-that the U.S. must understand its enemies. The other camp says
 her State Department record demonstrates she herself lacks the empathy to 
know how to deal with America's adversaries or allies.

Both responses are true, yet I have another observation about her speech: I
t is further evidence Mrs. Clinton is at best a mediocre presidential candi
date. She was lackluster in 2015 and worse today. The stiff, off-putting st
yle is familiar. What's more surprising is how sloppy, ill-prepared and ton
e-deaf she has become.

If Mrs. Clinton intended to say we must understand our adversaries-their mo
tivations, methods and goals-she should have said so. If her speechwriter's
 draft was unclear, she should have ordered a rewrite. If she can't summon 
warmth and wit now, how will she display a winning personality in her umpte
enth hundred event, assuming she becomes a candidate?

The empathy quote was memorialized on video. It may come back to haunt her:
 Sounding like President Obama on foreign policy isn't going to help her wi
n in 2016, when the world is likely to be more chaotic and American interes
ts even more threatened.

This is not Mrs. Clinton's first political misstep this year. There was her
 early summer book tour where she explained she and her husband were "dead 
broke" when they left the White House, nearly unable to afford their "house
s," and then went off on an NPR reporter who was trying to help her explain
 away her former opposition to gay marriage.

Campaigning for Democrats in the midterms was no better. On Oct. 24 in Bost
on, she uttered the inanity, "Don't let anybody tell you that, you know, it
's corporations and businesses that create jobs." By the way, there are few
 grateful Democrats whose campaigns she helped since almost all of them los
t.

After the election, more mistakes. At a Nov. 21 black-tie gala in New York,
 Mrs. Clinton endorsed Mr. Obama's executive order on immigration by sugges
ting the events' servers and food preparers were in the country illegally, 
as were most construction workers.

Reporters have largely overlooked Mrs. Clinton's blunders, but it is not in
conceivable that at least some of them may start holding her accountable to
 the standard they apply to gaffes uttered by Republican hopefuls.

Meanwhile, Hillary's operation promises to be entertaining. There have been
 news reports of infighting among her proto-campaign high command (never a 
good sign) that included the leak of emails thought to be embarrassing to a
n aspirant for campaign manager (never a good precedent).

Most telling-and damaging-she still has no core message. This is 22 months 
following her resignation as secretary of state. She suggested to Charlie R
ose on July 17 that she might focus on what to do "to tackle growth, which 
is the handmaiden of inequality." That sounds less like a message than a ta
ctic to placate the Democratic Party's populist Occupy Wall Street wing wit
h a pale imitation of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Even her husband frets she doesn't have a message. Former President Clinton
 recently told CNN that "we've reached a point in our life when we think yo
u really shouldn't run for office if you don't have a clear idea of what yo
u can do and a unique contribution you can make and you can outline that. N
ow that the book is done, she wants time to think about that and work throu
gh it. I think so much of politics is background noise, and we don't need t
he background noise anymore."

The next presidential election is in 23 months. But no amount of time is li
kely to be enough for Mrs. Clinton to make herself a much better candidate.
 She is who she is and cannot change. In 2015 she could not articulate a co
mpelling purpose for her run and stressed only her inevitability and entitl
ement. So far, it looks like Hillary 2.0 will have at least as many problem
s as Hillary 1.0.

It's hard for a political party to win three consecutive terms in the Oval 
Office. Since 1952, only George H.W. Bush was able to do it for his party a
fter Ronald Reagan 's two terms. Unfortunately for Democrats, Mr. Obama is 
no Reagan-and as they may soon find out, Hillary is no Bush 41.

Mr. Rove, a former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, helpe
d organize the political-action committee American Crossroads.
