    Dear 
        Customer,                         



        - Due to recent account 
        takeovers&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;is requesting a new account 
        verification procedure. From time to time, randomly selected accounts 
        are placed under an advanced updating process based on merchant 
        accounts/bank relations and on-file domain.com cards.&nbsp;Bank of 
        America&nbsp;may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies 
        of one or more photoID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your 
        domain.com card/bank account has expired, or if you have changed/replaced 
        your domain.com card without letting us know about the 
        change.



          Your account is not suspended, but if in 
          24 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed 
          we will terminate your&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;of 
          America&nbsp;subscription.



          If you received this notice and you are 
          not an authorized&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;account holder, please be 
          aware that it is in violation of&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;policy to 
          represent as an&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;user. Such action may also 
          be in violation of local, national, and/or international 
          law.



          Bank of America&nbsp;is committed to 
          assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to 
          misappropriate personal information with the intent to domain.com fraud or 
          theft. 



          Information will be provided at the 
          request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are 
          prosecuted to the full extent of the law.<A 
          target=_blank ul

        We apologize in advance for any 
        inconvenience this may cause you and we would like to thank you for your 
        cooperation as we review this matter.

    Dear 
        Customer,                         



        - Due to recent account 
        takeovers&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;is requesting a new account 
        verification procedure. From time to time, randomly selected accounts 
        are placed under an advanced updating process based on merchant 
        accounts/bank relations and on-file domain.com cards.&nbsp;Bank of 
        America&nbsp;may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies 
        of one or more photoID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your 
        domain.com card/bank account has expired, or if you have changed/replaced 
        your domain.com card without letting us know about the 
        change.



          Your account is not suspended, but if in 
          24 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed 
          we will terminate your&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;of 
          America&nbsp;subscription.



          If you received this notice and you are 
          not an authorized&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;account holder, please be 
          aware that it is in violation of&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;policy to 
          represent as an&nbsp;Bank of America&nbsp;user. Such action may also 
          be in violation of local, national, and/or international 
          law.



          Bank of America&nbsp;is committed to 
          assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to 
          misappropriate personal information with the intent to domain.com fraud or 
          theft. 



          Information will be provided at the 
          request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are 
          prosecuted to the full extent of the law.<A

        We apologize in advance for any

your
                authorization. If you recently accessed your account while 
                traveling, the log
                in attempts may have initiated by you.



                However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on 
                the link below and domain.com, as we try to verify your account.

                ISP host: shalmaneser1.al.cl.cam.ac.uk



                If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no
choice but to
                temporally suspend your account.
                We ask that you allow at least 48hrs for the case to be
investigated and
                we strongly recommend not making any changes to your
account in that
                time.
