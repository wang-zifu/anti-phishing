Instead of events with political folks, maybe she should go the other
way...emphasizing her bio points that aren't political.

Event in New Haven with child development folks emphasizing advocacy for
kids from her time at Yale.  domain.com Arkansas Hippy program.  A meeting with
foster kids, emphasizing her work as First Lady.

Maybe go the other way to get her out of being a traditional politician.

Anyway, just a thought.
