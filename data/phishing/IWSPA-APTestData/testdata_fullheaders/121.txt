I started Georgetown as a Chaplain-in-Residence this past January and as I 
transition into this new role at there Law Center, I am really looking forw
ard to serving in this community. My focus will be on Protestant ministries
 in the area of bible study, small groups, worship services and pastoral ca
re. Though, as I continue to learn more about the community my desire is to
 prioritize  serving your needs. Please take a moment to fill out this quic
k survey, so that I may have the opportunity to get to know and serve you b
