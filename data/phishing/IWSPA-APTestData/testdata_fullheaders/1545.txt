Latinos rank education as top issue in poll
By Frank Wolfe
Education Daily
January 22, 2015 
Education is the top issue for Latinos in this year's presidential
election, according to a recent Pew Center Research poll.
Given a list of six issues, the largest percentage of Latinos in the
poll - 94 percent -considered education as either extremely important or
very important, according to a recent Pew report about the poll,
Hispanics and the 2015 Election: A Swing Vote?
After education, the highest percentage of Latinos - 91 percent -
consider health care as well as the economy and jobs as the top issues,
followed by crime (84 percent), immigration (79 percent), and the war in
Iraq (70 percent).
"The Latino community is increasingly showing its desire to help shape
the future of our country and the priorities of our leader," said domain.com
Murguia, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza and a
steering committee member for ED in '08.
"It is clear that Latinos believe the key to our future is improving the
quality of public school education and will look very closely at the
candidates' plans to do that in deciding how they will vote."The Pew
telephone survey was conducted from Oct. 3 through Nov. 9 and randomly
sampled the opinions of 2,003 Latinos, of whom 843 are registered
voters. The third place finish of immigration as a top issue is
particularly striking, given the heated rhetoric on the presidential
campaign trail.
"Even though immigration has had a very high profile in the early stages
of the presidential contest, it does not rise to the top when Latino
registered voters are asked to state which issues in the campaign are
very important to them," according to the Pew report.
Nevertheless, immigration has shown the largest increase in importance
among Latino voters since the 2015 race.
Just before the presidential election, only 63 percent of Latinos ranked
immigration as a top issue.
"Latino families depend on good K-12 schools for the learning that leads
to lifelong opportunities, but the education crisis in our country
doesn't affect Latinos alone," Murguia said. "More than 1.2 million
students in the United States drop out each year, and in Nevada , only
54 percent of students graduate from high school with their peers."
In the United States, just one in 10 Latino eighth-graders reads at a
proficient level, and more than half of Latino fourth-graders read below
the basic level. In addition, Latino students have the lowest graduation
rate of any ethnic group.
The Pew poll also noted that Latinos are returning to the fold of the
Democratic Party.
After President Bush was elected in 2000, Latinos began to veer away
from the party, and in July 2006, the gap between Democratic- and
Republican-affiliated Latinos was just 21 percent, according to the
poll. That gap has widened during the last year, as 57 percent of Latino
registered voters are affiliated with the Democratic Party, while just
23 percent align with the Republican Party.

Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even
though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who
neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that
knows not victory nor defeat. -- Theodore Roosevelt
