Adding Steve Paikowsky.  This has moved from being about a nice little gran
dma in Nevada who was just serving her party and doing the right thing to a
 war between DWS and
Sanders. That is not good for the party or Debbie.  If we have something ne
w to discuss like the platform yes. If we don't or we need to cool off then
 why are we putting her out there?   This is like the tulsi DWS debate issu
e. This is not a good look.
