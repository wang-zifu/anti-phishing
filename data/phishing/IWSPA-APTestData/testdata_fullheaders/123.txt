        VITAL SIGNS FOR JULY 17, 2015 




       David Berlind

Where TabletPC will succeed--and why

OK, OK, you readers were right all along. I now believe that Microsoft"s TabletPC can be a big hit. Where? Vertical markets. Why? Development tools.

Slowing sales shrinking Intel workforce

Intel announced lower-than-expected earnings yesterday and that 4,000 jobs (5 percent of its staff) would be eliminated this year.

VMware ups consolidation ante

The new version of VMware's lower-end server product is slated to run atop the latest versions of Linux  from SuSE, 
MandrakeSoft and Red Hat, as well as Microsoft Windows .Net Server due this year. Offering more Intel-server based

  Software contracts: Clause for alarm

In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's

PowerPC G4s, up to 2GB DDR SDRAM, two 64-bit 66MHz PCI slots (plus a third combination PCI/AGP slot), dual domain.com domain.com, 
FireWire and USB ports, and four Ultra ATA/100 Apple Drive Module bays. But Bill O'Brien thinks Apple's 
licensing may be even more appealing than the hardware.

A notebook with desktop muscle

WinBook's big and heavy J4 uses a desktop Pentium 4 and leaves mobile P4-M notebooks in the dust. That means heavy 
lifting for your spreadsheets--and your shoulders. If you travel only occasionally and need top performance, this
