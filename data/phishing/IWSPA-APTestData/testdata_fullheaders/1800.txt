Hello Amy,

Social advertising is on the rise.  Projected to grow from $4.7B in 2015 to $11B a year in 2017, each social platform is making huge moves to further convince brands to invest in paid social media.  But how do you make sense of the changes Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are rolling out in the coming months?  What ad types will yield the best results?  What is a healthy budget to truly test paid social advertising?
