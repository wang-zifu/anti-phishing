Dear PayPal 
    account holder,10:23 AM 7/9/2008

Due to recent attacks on multiple PayPal accounts and cardholders,

PayPal Online Department has created and implemented a new

security system designed to protect your account and provide

an increased level of protection to your money and personal data.

After multiple invalid login attempts on your account, we have

strong reasons to believe that it might have been accessed by an

unauthorized third party. This may be due to changes in your IP

address or location. Protecting the security of your account and

the PayPal network is our primary concern.

Therefore, PayPal Online Department has limited your access to 

sensitive account features until your personal and financial information

are confirmed.

Once you have completed the steps required to remove the limitation,

please allow us 24 hours to review the information submitted.

In order to remove the limitation on your account, please follow the link below

to one of our secure servers: 

<>:8011/domain.com/cgi-bin/webscr=cmd=p 

Case Id: PP - 39 - 19765 - 329

Notification reason: Suspicion of account theft and/or fraud attempt.

Date: July 10, 2015 

Note: If you received this message in your Spam/Bulk folder, that is

because of the restrictions implemented by your isp.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

We appreciate your business and the opportunity to serve your needs.
