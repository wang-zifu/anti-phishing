Hi gang, want us to be assertive on this one? In the past I've said something like:

"We're not going to get into specifics beyond telling you that the President's voice will be particularly powerful in light of the progress we've made over the last seven years. He's an effective messenger to remind voters of how far we've come, of where we were when George W. Bush left office losing 800,000 jobs a month, with too many Americans losing their homes and savings."

Hey User -- hope you're well. Wanted to touch base again to see what more you can say on President Obama's role going forward in the presidential race -- even though the nomination process is still ongoing, are there places/areas you guys see him playing a major role? How eager are Democrats to get him out on the trail?

Thanks
Kevin
