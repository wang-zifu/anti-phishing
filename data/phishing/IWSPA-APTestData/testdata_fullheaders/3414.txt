Perl Journal. I just heard from the SysAdmin editors. Ad revenues are
down so much that all tech mags are apparently in dire straits, and
SysAdmin has basically been taking a big loss on TPJ for a while now; and
the money people say that it just can't keep doing that. So the issue
that's in the mail now is apparently [2]the last."
