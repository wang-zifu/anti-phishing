If you are looking for a ring that will catch some attention, this Internally Flawless 3.93 carat Natural Light Pink Pear Shape Diamond ring might be just what you've been looking for!




What makes this diamond particularly unique is the fact that it has been tested, verified, and certified as a Type 2A diamond by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).




Type 2A diamonds are exceptionally rare because they contain very little or absolutely no traces of nitrogen resulting in a much more pure diamond crystal.  They make up less than 2% of the World's diamond supply and less than one tenth of that 2% are natural pink diamonds, very few comparable in size or color.




The diamond is mounted in a beautiful handmade platinum and 18k rose gold ring and elegantly complimented by 56 natural sparkling round brilliant cut diamonds weighing 1.33cttw.
