Hi -

Wanted you to know about a very exciting development: President Clinton wil
l be in the district this Sunday from 430pm-6pm in support of Sean's campai
gn.

In addition to a rally, the President will also be doing a VIP reception th
at will allow attendees to meet and have their pictures taken with the him.

Because of very limited space, attendance is on a first-come first-served l
imited to people making new contributions to the campaign. If you're intere
sted in attending, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks so much and please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions o
r if there's any way I can be of assistance.

Best -

Tom
