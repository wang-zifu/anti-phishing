																		 You and a guest are invited to
TheWrap's Award Season Screening Series Presentation of




FINDING VIVIAN MAIER takes us from New York to France to Chicago and across the globe following the mysterious life of Vivian Maier - a career nanny who, upon her death in 2009, left behind over 100,000 photos and negatives. John Maloof, a then 26-year-old amateur historian, discovered this treasure trove at an auction and made it his mission to put Vivian Maier in the history books.




In FINDING VIVIAN MAIER, Maloof and filmmaker Charlie Siskel trace this gifted artist's double life by tracking down the children (now adults) who Maier nannied, the parents who employed her, and dozens of others who thought they knew her. The film unravels the story of a profound and complex woman who The New York Times called "one of America's more insightful street photographers," becoming not only a celebration of one of the greatest unsung artists of our time, but also a mind boggling investigation to discover who Vivian Maier really was
