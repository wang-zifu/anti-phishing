John --

Since we asked you to take a stand last week, over 900 of you signed our 
petition telling Congress that we won't accept irresponsible sequester 
cuts. That's great! And it proves this issue seriously hits home for you.

Take the Rock Island Arsenal right here in Illinois' 17th district: the 
sequester budget cuts are having a seriously detrimental effect on 
civilian workers. How? Let's break it down:

A minimum of 11 unpaid days off
A 500,000 hour cut for the entire Arsenal workforce
An average of $3,000 in wage losses for each of six thousand employees 
(that's $18 million total!)
Middle-class families simply cannot afford these cuts -- and Congress 
needs to fix this NOW. Cheri's working hard to find a solution, but she 
needs your help.

Stand with Cheri: Will you sign your name to help us reach 1,000 strong to 
STOP the sequester and support Illinois workers?

We all know these cuts are wrong, now we need to do something about it.

Thanks for stepping up,

Team Bustos
