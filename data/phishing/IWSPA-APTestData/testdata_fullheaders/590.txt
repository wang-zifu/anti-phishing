Doug,

Hi.  Happy New Year.  I hope you are well.

The International Campaign for Tibet has tried several channels to get a
response from Secretary Clinton on her position on Tibet as a candidate
without getting a response.  I=E2=80=99m attaching the questionnaire and be
low is a
copy of the email that was sent with the questionnaire.

If you could please forward this to someone in the campaign who can respond
on the issue before we publish the responses from the candidates it would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Lesley

Dear Secretary Clinton,

On behalf of the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), I am writing to
you to respectfully request that you respond to questions submitted below
regarding your positions on the Tibet issue.  ICT works to promote human
rights and democratic freedoms for the people of Tibet. ICT does this by
monitoring and reporting on conditions in Tibet, advocating for Tibetan
political prisoners, mobilizing individuals and the international community
to take action on behalf of Tibetans, and working to strengthen
relationships between Tibetan and Chinese individuals and institutions.  We
promote self-determination for the Tibetan people through negotiations
between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama.

Founded in 1988, ICT, a 501(c)(3) organization, maintains offices in
Washington, DC, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Brussels, along with a field office
in Dharamsala, India.

The questions and answers will be published verbatim on our website,
*domain.com* <<<link>>>, as we receive them.  Please
send your response promptly to ensure that we can share your positions with
our over 60,000 active members in a timely manner.  If you do not respond,
our report will state =E2=80=98Did Not Respond.=E2=80=99

Please send your responses to user@domain.com
<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','user@domain.com');>.

As a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, we cannot support or oppose any candidate for public office.

We hope that you will take this opportunity to communicate your views on
the Tibet issue as a candidate for the office of the President of the
United States.

Sincerely,
