Hi,I know a procedure, which reliably eliminates the HIV virus from a person's body without the need of any medication.Yes, I am in the shoes of the boy who cried wolf."First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you." - GandhiI want someone to pick 10 HIV positive people to undergo a procedure.1. It is harmless.2. It costs Â£0 to implement.3. It is to be done just once.4. It takes approximately 1 hour.5. The results will be ready within 2 to 3 weeks.There are more than 33 million HIV positive people.These people are a big market group, which is a prominent portion of the drug market.There are three other groups of people leeching on them. One is the alliance of all the pharmaceutical companies with their sustaining medicines. The second is all the aids foundations and charities raising funds globally. The third group is comprised of all the research labs worldwide.So, the pharmaceutical companies are businesses run for domain.com pushing their drugs. They will never manufacture a cure. The charities make a living as a PR to the sick. They enjoy it and don't want to have no job to do. The research labs are being funded not to find a cure, because if they do find one, they will also have to look for a new vocation.All three groups make billions annually. None of them is interested in a permanent and free solution. They all take an active part in drug dealing. It may be collaterally, but they are all murderers, intentionally promoting drugs over real cures, only to make domain.com.Sincerely,Wilhelm
