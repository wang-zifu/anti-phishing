The eagerly awaited new film from filmmaker, actor and poet Yılmaz Erdoğan, best known for his box-office record-breaking debut comedy film Vizontele, is a powerful, gripping and dazzling tale of young lives and loves. Set in the 1940s during World War II in the Black Sea city of Zonguldak, it is the story of two poets, Rüştü Onur and Muzaffer Tayyip Uslu, and their literature teacher at High School, the poet Behçet Necatigil. The two young men dream of brilliant futures, but perhaps this is not to be. An outstanding cast includes the big-screen debut of heart throb Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ, but his is just one of the outstanding performances in a moving and memorable movie.
