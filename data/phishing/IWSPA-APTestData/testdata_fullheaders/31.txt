Spoke to Senator Sanders

*         Giving both campaigns to recommend 4 people each for the drafting committee, DWS last 7 including Chair of drafting committee.

*         4, 4, 7 = 15

*         If you did that...

*         Need names by May 9th.

*         Wouldn't be surprised

*         Leah call Mark Longabaugh to deliver same message.
