Lex,




This is exciting news about Ghostbusters 3 and is perfectly timed as we have just locked Ivan Reitman and Dan Akroyd for a retrospective interview to go on the Ghostbusters 30th / GBII 25th Anniversary Blu-ray and DVD releases in September.    We have an invitation in to Bill Murray and have been told by his lawyer that she has reach out to him and he will call us if he is interested in taking part.




The interview will take place next Tuesday 3/25, on Stage 22, with a call time around 3pm.




The set will be staged with the Ecto-1, props from both movies, and a bunch of the Ghostbusters consumer products.




Once we have everything solidified, we will work with Staci in publicity to see if we can get coverage banked for our release.




Given this Deadline news, we should let Amy know.




Tracey
