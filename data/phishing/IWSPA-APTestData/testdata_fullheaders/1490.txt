Fwd: Variety just called me about a Spidey story

FYI - update on Variety's attempt to do a Spidey cover.  I think we treat it similarly to WSJ.  If we need to do a light touch to correct things that are wrong or do a quick hit, that's ok, but no need to participate in corporate stories at this time.  This does not mean that publicity won't continue to drive hard on positive stories focused on the movie itself.  Let me know if you feel differently.

 I just told Claudia we won't be participating other than maybe a light sprinkle.  I can't imagine Alexandra does anything pleasant and we are focused on publicity stories, not corporate stories, which this is.
