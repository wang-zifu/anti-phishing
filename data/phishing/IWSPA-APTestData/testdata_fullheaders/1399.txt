Attached is Sony's cost run. 




They aren't budging on $600,000K up front, with $1.2 in first position debt.  




Entire indy production is budgeted at $1.8M -- all in.




Could manage $200,000K up front, $200,000 in first position debt.




Otherwise, producer will scrap Sony script entirely, do another adaptation that cleaves strictly to the novel, and not owe Sony a penny.




Galt Neiderhoffer is both the author and indy producer -- three movies at Sundance this year.




Brian Burkin is Sony's B.A. person on it -- not returning Galt's phone calls.

Here is the cost run.  Galt should really take over from here and engage with the studio to figure out if this is right.  She will know how much was paid for  the option, etc.

Best,




Mel
