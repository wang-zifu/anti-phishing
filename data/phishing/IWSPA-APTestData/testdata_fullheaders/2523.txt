Hi everyone -

Sending along remarks for the IA women for Hillary event tomorrow -
essentially the New Hampshire speech she's been giving, but with an added
section on campus sexual assault. I'm including that text in the body of
this email as well.

This reflects input from Jen Klein and Rachel Vogelstein, plus Maya and Dan
.

If possible, please send me your edits by 4:30 so we can get this in the
book by 5.

Thank you!

=C2=B7     At a time when more women than ever are pursuing higher educatio
n,
making college affordable, helping people refinance their student debt, and
making it easier for students with kids of their own to find childcare=E2
=80=A6 are
all women=E2=80=99s issues.

=C2=B7     *And so is confronting the epidemic of sexual assault on college
campuses across the country. *

=C2=B7     One in five women report that they were sexually assaulted durin
g
college.  That=E2=80=99s one in five women enduring a horrific experience a
nd
managing the aftermath at a time when they should be free to learn and
pursue their dreams.  Think of the costs: emotional, physical, financial.
Some survivors miss class.  Others drop out.  Some never finish their
education.

=C2=B7     For too long, this issue has been ignored, trivialized, and even
tolerated.  The stories break your heart.  One after another.  But they
need to do more than that.  They need to stir us to action.

=C2=B7     It=E2=80=99s not enough to condemn campus sexual assault.  We ha
ve to stop
campus sexual assault.

=C2=B7     Thanks to the courage and determination of survivors and advocat
es,
America is waking up to this challenge.  On campuses across the country,
they have come together to bring attention to this issue, to support each
other, and to change laws and policies.

=C2=B7     That advocacy has sparked the beginnings of good work around the
country.  Leaders on campus =E2=80=93 including many with us today =E2=80
=93 are striving
to take the right steps for their students.  President Obama=E2=80=99s
administration has worked hard to shine a light on campus sexual assault.
I will build on the progress that=E2=80=99s been made =E2=80=93 and I will 
work for
solutions that go even further.

=C2=B7     First: Every campus needs to make sure that every survivor =E2
=80=93 no
matter their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or race =E2=80=93 has a
ccess to
the support they need.  And those services should be comprehensive,
confidential, and coordinated.

=C2=B7     Second: We need to ensure a fair process for all involved =E2=80
=93 whether
that=E2=80=99s in campus disciplinary proceedings or the criminal justice s
ystem.
Rape is a crime =E2=80=93 wherever it happens =E2=80=93 and reports need to
 be treated with
the seriousness they deserve.

=C2=B7     And third: We need to recognize that it=E2=80=99s not enough to 
address this
problem by responding only once sexual assault occurs.  We need to stop
sexual assault from happening in the first place.  We need strong
prevention efforts to change attitudes that lead to violence.  We should be
talking to young people about consent and bystander prevention long before
students ever set foot on campus.

=C2=B7     This issue is much bigger than a single conversation at freshman
orientation.  It=E2=80=99s about the messages we send every day.

=C2=B7     *So today I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual
assault: Don=E2=80=99t let anyone silence your voice.  You have the right t
o be
heard.  You have the right to be believed. We=E2=80=99re with you.*

=C2=B7     And remember, sexual assault doesn=E2=80=99t just happen on camp
us.  It
happens in the workplace.  It happens in the military.  For too many women,
it happens in their own homes and communities.  We need to take on this
problem as part of our broader commitment to end violence against women and
girls across the country and around the world.
