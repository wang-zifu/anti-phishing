Any public statement we deliver needs to be deliberative. I know Brad Marti
n from the EDs side and Ken Martin from the Chairs side have been working o
n possible language. Because this is something both associations are workin
g on we would appreciate everyone holding off talking to Politico until we 
can get votes from both bodies on agreed upon language. Thanks for the head
s up on this.

Warmest Regards,
