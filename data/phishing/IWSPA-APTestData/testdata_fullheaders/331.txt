At the AFLCIO in Washington, DC

815 16th Street, NW

(within sight of the White House!!)

Join us for Free Food and Drinks (courtesy of the AFLCIO) and The

Chronicling the Disastrous Legacy of President Bush and the Conservative
Policies he and His Allies Have Pursued.  The cookout will begin at

Please Join us for this Important Event and Spread the Word.
Progressives CANNOT Allow The History of The Bush Presidency and the
Consequences of Conservative Ideology to be Defined by Others.  If we

Intractable Problems That we All Crave - We have to Define
Bush-Conservative Ideology for What it is: A Disaster.  Hope to See You
on Tuesday.

Brad Woodhouse, President
