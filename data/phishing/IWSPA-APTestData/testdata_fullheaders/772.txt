Re: 22JS intl Update Sat a.m.

Too early to say (in a good way).  Germany and Russia can swing pendulum a lot as can the holds in Australia and UK.  What is great is that UK/Aus won't be 1/2 the intl number this time around but rather less and I think those 2 markets headed past $50MM combined for sure
