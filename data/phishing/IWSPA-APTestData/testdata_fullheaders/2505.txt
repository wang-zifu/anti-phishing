Make 10,000 a Month - Just Write a Book

Well this author is doing just that




HOW? YOU ASK - SIMPLE - WRITE A GOOD BOOK!
Here is a perfect example of how you too can do it!

African Chess by Frank Graves is a newly updated and revamped book of political conspiracy, adventure thriller that was originally published in 1990.

Recent events in South Africa such as Nelson Mandela's Death, Oscar Pistorius's Trial, Shrien Dewani's Extradition for Murder, 16,259 Murders in 2012/13 and Epidemic Governmental Corruption have all helped to heighten international attention drawing in huge focus on that country. This marketing opportunity means that African Chess has come out in a completly updated format.

Graves is completing the rewrite of Ancestral Trail Trilogy this time in full book format (450 pages each) to be published in three stages between Januuary 2015 and July 2014. (The first book of the trilogy "Long Ago & Far Away" was published in January 2014.)

His original work has become cultist with various parts continually being traded globally from within the domain.com Auction Rooms. Each of 52 issues were originally centered on an adventure against a particular adversary and each issue ended on a cliffhanger. (The New Trilogy consists of the Mythological World - Cyber World - Present Day World).

His overall intention is to then publish the Ancestral Trail Trilogy plus a further three adult thrillers similar to African Chess during 2015 which means another 5 books will be released during this year.

Lastly, if you should domain.com one of the above links such as domain.com (We suggest using the Kindle Section for the Better Sample Reader) to see what the books are about, please be so kind as to leave a review, it always helps the author seller rating in the long run.

That's how it is done!
