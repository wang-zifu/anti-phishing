Yes. Tried your cell. It's the CAP fundraiser that night. I have to go for
a little bit, but would rather have dinner with you. It's at the Newseum.
We could meet there if you are so inclined and go out to the house or a
restaurant. Or I can meet you near your hotel at a restaurant or just meet
up at the house around 8:00. Preference?
