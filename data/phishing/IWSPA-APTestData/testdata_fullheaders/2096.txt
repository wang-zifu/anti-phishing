Democratic strategists are concerned that on top of refusing to fundraise for the Party, the increasing attacks from the Sanders campaign and threats to blow up the convention are going to make it harder to unite the Party and help Republicans Trump.

Bernie's campaign is coming to terms with the fact that the math won't ever work in their favor, and their increasing attacks on the Party are a desperate attempt to stay relevant and stem the bleeding since they already dropped 40% last month from the previous one.
