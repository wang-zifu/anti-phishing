John,

Hope all is well.

I am at the AWEA conference in Orlando and the business mood is very positiv
e.

I would love to be helpful to the campaign on energy issues, if that would b
e helpful. The DOE loan portfolio is now on track to make 5 billion in profi
t and I am meeting regularly with, and doing business with, many of the lead
ers of the clean economy.

What can I do to be helpful? Would be pleased to build an energy working gro
up, a clean energy leaders for Clinton, serve as a surrogate for the candida
te at appropriate events, whatever would be useful.

Best,
Jonathan
