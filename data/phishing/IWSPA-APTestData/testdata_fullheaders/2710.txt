Webinar: Eliminating Blind Spots with Continuous Asset Discovery

If you don’t know it exists, how do you know it’s secure?

Date: Wednesday, June 17, 2015 Time: 2 pm ET/11 am PT  Register Now

Hello EUGENE,
Your networks and subnets can have hundreds of access points, large  numbers of connected devices not managed by group policy, roaming  laptops, and mobile devices that are often disconnected when scans  occur. If an unauthorized device is used to exfiltrate data from your  network, “I didn’t know it was on our network,” is not an acceptable  excuse.
Instead, you need to eliminate blind spots created by BYOD and unauthorized SaaS applications.
To learn how, join us at 2 PM ET on June 17, for Eliminating Blind Spots  with Continuous Asset Discovery, a webinar for InfoSec practitioners  hosted by Bill Olson, Director of Product Management and Ted Gary, product marketing manager, SecurityCenter™, Tenable  Network Security.
Topics covered:

Discovering all assets, including transient mobile, virtual, and cloud services on your network
Gaining actionable insight into the OS, services, and vulnerabilities associated with transient devices and systems
The problem of unauthorized services and data in domain.com
Identifying devices that may be compromised and communicating with suspicious botnets and command and control channels
Your questions

Maintaining an up-to-date inventory of the assets on your network is  critical for achieving effective security. Asset visibility is a  foundational part of most information security frameworks – its control  #1 in the Council on CyberSecurity 20 Critical Controls.
It’s common sense; if you don’t know it exists, you can’t know if it is secure.
By attending this webinar you will gain an understanding of how  continuous asset discovery provides continuous and complete visibility  across your entire IT environment. The session will explore the  capabilities of Tenable SecurityCenter™ Continuous View, which uses a  combination of active, passive and event-based technologies to ensure  that all assets on the network are identified, along with their related  vulnerabilities and threats, so you can prioritize risk-based  remediation.
