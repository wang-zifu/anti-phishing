Hi All - 

After seeing Lekha Singh's haunting film, "Beyond Right and Wrong," I realized that it perfectly expresses what I have finally learned -- that Life is truly For-giving.  Lekha takes viewers across the globe on a journey of forgiveness that brings us back to ourselves, reminding us of Archbishop Desmond Tutu's famous quote, "Not forgiving is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die."

Please join Lekha at the Laemmle on July 8th or July 15th and also domain.com Creative Visions Foundation!  And if you can, please download or borrow my new memoir, "In the Heart of Life" - and learn how I finally learned to forgive the Somalis who killed Dan, and finally, myself.

p.s. If you can't make it to the film, watch it online and we still domain.com!  See below.

Happy Fourth of July!  Love, Kathy

Beyond Right & Wrong synopsis: A woman who survived the death of her five children wonders if she can forgive the man who killed them.  A victim's daughter strikes up an unusual friendship with the bomber who killed her father.  And two men - one Israeli, one Palestinian - form a bond after tragedies claim their daughters.
