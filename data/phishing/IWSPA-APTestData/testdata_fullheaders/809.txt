The proposal is an organizing meeting with some electeds. Our grassroots
team has put a list together of the folks who are working in the various
districts we need. As we discussed, the vision is everyday folks and the
folks we need to start the work of organizing. We are using this as a
training meeting as well as to make sure local/CO press know that we are
meeting with community members and building what we need on the ground. As
we talked about, we are not doing an electeds meeting because this will
further harm the perception you were concerned about in our conversations.
The vision is that the majority of folks will be invites from our
grassroots team.

Jessica and Victoria are our key leads on this event. We will contact Mayor
Webb separately but need our advance team to report back the numbers that
are possible for them in this venue.

From there, we will put together the combo of invites we should have in the
room.

Thank you for these names.
