  A few minutes ago, our online channel launched a new series today called Bee & PuppyCat*, created by first time filmmaker Natasha Allegri. If you get a minute, please click here to watch it, I think it'll entertain you tremendously. 




    *If you'd like to read a bit more on the show and its creator Natasha, the Wall Street Journal ("How Frederator’s Bee and PuppyCat Became One of YouTube’s Most Anticipated Shows") 
      and New York Magazine ("The Top Female Filmmaker on Kickstarter") posted a couple of great pieces today.
