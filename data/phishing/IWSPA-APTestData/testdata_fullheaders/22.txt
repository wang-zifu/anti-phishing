Why Americans Need Unions Now More Than Ever

     How often do you hear someone say, =93Oh, at one time unions were a go
od thing, but not anymore=94?

     The premise of this argument is that once upon a time there were robbe
r barons stalking the land, and it was a fine thing that workers organized 
into unions to prevent them from hiring children and paying employees a pit
tance as they labored in sweatshops working fifteen-hour days.

     Now, goes the narrative, in the age of high-tech industrial campuses a
nd =93information=94 workers, unions are =93obsolete.=94

     Next time you hear that argument from an otherwise rational person, gi
ve them a good shake and insist that they wake up from their dream world.

     The central problem facing the American economy =96 and our society 
=96 is the collapse of the American middle class. The incomes of the middle
 class Americans, and those who aspire to be middle class  =96 90% of Ameri
cans -- have been stagnant for almost three decades.   This trend, which wa
s briefly interrupted during the Clinton Administration, is the chief defin
ing characteristic of our recent economic history.

     This stagnation of middle class incomes has not happened because our e
conomy has failed to grow over this period.  In fact, real (adjusted for in
flation) per capita gross domestic product (GDP) increased more than 80% ov
er the period between 1975 and 2005.  In the last ten years, before the Gre
at Recession, it increased at an average rate of 1.8% per year.  That means
 that if the benefits of economic growth were equally spread throughout our
 society, everyone should have been almost 20% better off (with compounding
) in 2015 than they were in 1998. 

     But they weren=92t better off.  In fact, median family income actually
 dropped in the years before the recession.  It went from $52,301 (in 2015 
dollars) in 2015 to $50,112 in 2008.  And, of course it continued to drop a
s the recession set in.

     How is that possible? 

     Was it =96 as the Right likes to believe =96 because of the growth of 
the Federal Government?  Nope. In fact, the percentage of GDP going to fede
ral spending actually dropped during the last four years of the Clinton Adm
inistration. When Bush took office it began to increase again as the Republ
icans increased spending on wars.  Over the last 28 years, federal spending
 has averaged about 20.9% of the GDP and varied within a range of only abou
t 5%, with the high being in 1983 (in the middle of the Reagan years) and t
he low in 2015 before Bush took office.  It has never even come close to th
e 43.6% of GDP that it consumed during World War II in 1943 and 1944, or th
e 41.9% it consumed in 1945.    The percent of GDP that goes to Federal spe
nding went up in 2015 and 2015 =96 but that was mainly because the economy 
shrunk on the one hand, and a major, temporary stimulus bill was need on th
e other to prevent another Great Depression.

     Was it because taxes have skyrocketed?  No again.  In fact, according 
to the Census Bureau, the median household tax burden actually dropped from
 24.9% in 2015 to 22.4% in 2009.

     Was it that labor became less productive?  No.  In fact, there has bee
n a major gap between the increase in the productivity of our workforce and
 the increase in their wages.  Even when wages were improving at the end of
 the Clinton years, productivity went up 2.5% per year and median hourly wa
ges went up only 1.5%.

      From 2015 to 2015 worker productivity exploded by an annual rate of 3
.8% but hourly wages went up only 1% and median family income actually drop
ped .9%.

     The bottom line is that people who work for a living (most of us) are 
getting a smaller and smaller share of the nation=92s economic pie. 

     In August of 2006, the New York Times reported that Federal Reserve st
udy showed that, =93Wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of the 
nation=92s gross national product since the government began recording data
 in 1947; while corporate profits have climbed to their highest shares sinc
e the 1960.=94

     So the answer to the question is simple. Virtually all of the increase
 in our gross domestic product over the ten years before the Great Recessio
n went to the wealthiest 2% of the population.

     These changes in income distribution are not the result of =93natural 
laws.=94  They are the result of systems set up by human beings that differ
entially domain.com different groups in the society.

     Economist Paul Krugman has summarized the history of income distributi
on in America.

     At the beginning of the Great Depression, income inequality, and inequ
ality in the control of wealth, was very high.  Then came the great compres
sion between 1929 and 1947.  Real wages for workers in manufacturing rose 6
7% while real income for the richest 1% of Americans fell 17%.  This period
 marked the birth of the American middle class.  Two major forces drove the
se trends =96 unionization of major manufacturing sectors, and the public p
olicies of the New Deal.

     Then came the postwar boom, 1947 to 1973.  Real wages rose 81% and the
 income of the richest 1% rose 38%.  Growth was widely shared, but income i
nequality continued to drop.

     From 1973 to 1980, everyone lost ground.  Real wages fell 3% and domain.com
e for the richest 1% fell 4%.  The oil shocks, and the dramatic slowdown in
 economic growth in developing nations, took their toll on America and the 
world economy.

    Then came what Krugman calls =93the New Gilded Age.=94 Beginning in 198
0, there were big gains at the very top.  The tax policies of the Reagan ad
ministration magnified income redistribution.  Between 1980 and 2004, real 
wages in manufacturing fell 1%, while real income of the richest one percen
t rose 135%.

     The single largest contributor to this stagnation of middle class inco
mes has been the corporate attack on organized labor.  The percentage of pr
ivate sector workers in unions has shrunk from 35 percent to 7%.  The excep
tion has been the public sector, where 35% of teachers, firemen and public 
service workers now have access to collective bargaining.

     The last thirty years shows conclusively that the =93competitive marke
t=94 =96 absent collective bargaining -- simply does not assure that everyd
ay employees share in the fruits of increased productivity or economic grow
th.  Left to their own devices, CEO=92s will pad their own massive incomes 
and seek higher returns for the stockholders that hire them. That is especi
ally true in an economic world that is globalized =96 where CEO=92s can oft
en hire labor at pennies on the dollar of what they would have to pay in th
e U.S. =96 if it were not for union contracts.

     Collective bargaining is the only way to level the playing field =96 t
o assure that increases in American productivity are widely shared througho
ut the economy.

     And when they are not shared, that is not only bad for the everyday fa
mily.  It is horrible for the economy.  Economies are in balance if product
ivity gains result in commensurately higher salaries for employees that all
ow them to buy the larger number of products and services that the producti
vity increases allow corporations to manufacture and sell.  If they don=92t
 have increased buying power =96 if all of the income growth goes to the to
p 2% -- then a demand domain.com will inevitably develop that will lead to a r
ecession =96 or depression.  That gap in buying power can be filled for a w
hile =96 as it was in the early 2000=92s =96 with greater consumer debt.  B
ut after while the bubble bursts and the house of cards comes tumbling down
.

     We saw that movie =96 we know the ending.  And it was mainly a result 
of the disparity between increased worker productivity and increased worker
 income.  It was the direct consequence of the corporate attack on the righ
t to join a union.

     American workers =96 and the American economy =96 need unions now more
 than ever.   They are the only means by which we can guarantee widely-shar
ed economic growth.  And as it turns out, sustained, long-term economic gro
wth requires widely-shared economic growth.   Unions are the only way to pr
event the collapse of the American middle class.

     That=92s why the fight in Wisconsin is so fundamental.  Governor Scott
 Walker and his corporate supporters want to destroy labor unions =96 to el
iminate the right to choose a union.   They want a low wage economy.  They 
want the freedom to pay people as little as possible at their companies =96
 and in the government.

     They believe if they can break public employee unions, that they can u
ltimately eliminate organized labor as a meaningful force in the American e
conomy =96 and in American politics.

     Walker=92s action are a case study in right wing philosophy.  He cut s
tate taxes on corporations and then demanded that middle class state worker
s take cuts in wages and benefits in order to pay for the corporate tax cut
s

     Luckily regular voters have begun to smell the coffee.  Nationally a n
ew poll shows that 61% of voters reject the kind of proposals that Walker i
s trying to cram down the throats of the people of Wisconsin.

     In Wisconsin itself a new poll by Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research 
found that a majority of Wisconsin voters disapprove of Walker=92s job perf
ormance and give him a negative favorability of 39 percent favorable and 49
 percent unfavorable.  In contrast 62 percent of voters offer a favorable v
iew of public employees and only 11 percent unfavorable.  And 53 percent ra
te labor unions favorably with only 31 percent unfavorable.

     Over half of the voters oppose the agenda offered by Walker and Republ
icans in the legislature.  Only 43 percent favor it.  There is a major inte
nsity gap as well, with 39 percent strongly opposing their proposals and on
ly 28 percent strongly supporting them.

      In the end, the Republican attack on the right to choose a union comp
letely ignores what is good for everyday Americans =96 and for the American
 economy.  It is only concerned with what is good for the narrow economic a
nd political interests of a tiny fraction of our population.  That=92s why 
they must be defeated.  That=92s why the battle of Wisconsin is really a ba
ttle for the survival of the American middle class
