*Democrats take aim at McCain's temper** (Politico, 08/26/08)*
By Daniel W. Reilly
John McCain's Democratic colleagues in the Senate are zeroing in on his
oft-discussed temper, questioning whether the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee is too volatile to be commander in chief. In separate
interviews with Politico on Tuesday, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin
(D-Ill.) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said they have seen McCain
"explode." "He has a huge anger problem," Boxer said. "And he never hid
that. ... I have seen it happen on the Senate floor many, many times. =85 H
e
has exploded at me a couple times."

*Decision on Offshore Drilling to Test Nominees (WSJ 08/27/08)*
By Stephen Power
After Barack Obama and John McCain claim their parties' nominations, the
senators will have to decide whether to back an energy-policy compromise
that is uncomfortable for some members of their parties but represents a
middle ground where many voters stand.
The plan, put forward by a so-called "Gang of 10" Republican and Democratic
senators, would allow oil and gas drilling in some offshore areas that are
off limits -- a move opposed by many Democratic leaders. The plan would
raise $84 billion for various alternative energy and conservation measures,
partly by taking away certain tax deductions from oil companies -- an idea
opposed by many Republicans. Congress is likely to debate the drilling issu
e
in September.

*Romney: McCain earned his homes; Obama didn't (Boston Globe, 08/26/08)*
By Scott Helman
Former governor Mitt Romney, perhaps continuing his audition to be John
McCain's running mate, attacked Barack Obama today for making an issue out
of McCain's many homes.  Speaking to reporters at a lunch sponsored by the
Christian Science Monitor, Romney said that while McCain deserved his house
s
because of the "hard work" of himself and his family, "Barack Obama got a
special deal from a convicted felon."  "I think it was a strange thing for
Barack Obama to seize upon," Romney said. "If homes is going to be the topi

one."

 *McCain Holds Celeb-Packed Fundraiser (Washington Post 08/26/08)*
by Michael Shear
Sen. John McCain may continue to attack Sen. Barack Obama as a celebrity,
but that doesn't mean that McCain is above associating with them.  At a
fundraiser in the heart of Hollywood Monday night, McCain rubbed elbows wit
h
a chorus of television and movie stars while raising some cash in the final
days before his Republican convention. About 1,600 crammed into a ballroom
at the Beverly Hills Hilton, the campaign said.  Earlier, Patricia Heaton,
star of "Everybody Loves Raymond" joined McCain on the Straight Talk Air
today for a flight from Sacramento to Burbank, descending down the front
stairs of the plane together and posing for pictures.  And in the morning,
Daddy Yankee, one of the biggest stars in the Latino community, endorsed
McCain in front of a gaggle of screaming teenagers, then joined McCain for 
a
leg on the plane.  Before the fundraiser, McCain taped an appearance on "Th
e
Tonight Show with Jay Leno."

Romney
is 'job-killing machine,' Dem says (domain.com News 08/26/08)
By Gordon Trowbridge
The head of Barack Obama's campaign on Monday described Mitt Romney as "a
job-killing machine" who would hurt the John McCain campaign's economic
appeal if he joins the Republican presidential ticket.  "This is someone wh
o
was a job-killing machine in business," Plouffe said. "He's someone who has
been proficient at using tax havens in places like the Cayman Islands that
Americans have become increasingly tired of.  "Will (naming Romney) help in
Michigan? I don't know," Plouffe said. "But on things like outsourcing,
there's almost an acceptance (by Romney) that it's OK to have all this job
loss."

Biden: McCain doesn't fully support loans for auto industry (domain.com Free
Press, 08/26/08)
By Justin Hyde
Democratic vice presidential hopeful Joe Biden wasted no time today in
hitting Republican Sen. John McCain on auto industry issues, saying McCain
does not fully support the industry's bid for $50 billion in government
loans.  After McCain announced his support for some loan funding on Friday,
Barack Obama's campaign said it would back the full $50 billion request ove
r
three years, which would cost the government roughly $7.5 billion.
Automakers plan to press Congress to approve the funds before it adjourns
this year.  "John McCain has not only opposed these much needed loans for
our domestic auto makers, he has openly criticized and shown disdain for
them," Biden said in a statement today. "His recent statements have shown
once again that he is not only out of touch with American workers, but that
he isn't being candid about what he does, and doesn't, support."

Is Mitt Romney ready to debate Joe Biden? That was the question posed to th

McCain, including: that McCain is "outside the mainstream of Republican

bill and the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill.

OPINIONS AND EDITORIALS McCain takes after Obama in Legion speech (Politico
,
08/26/08)
By Jonathan Martin
John McCain came very close Tuesday morning to outright questioning Barack
Obama's patriotism, painting his Democratic rival as a detached, cocksure
candidate who believes too much in internationalism and not enough in the
stand-alone strength of America.  Speaking to a crowd of several thousand
American Legion veterans at the Phoenix Convention Center, McCain went righ
t
after Obama's strength =97 his rock star appearance in Berlin earlier this
month, saying Obama "was the picture of confidence."
"But confidence in oneself and confidence in one's country are not the
same," McCain said. McCain's campaign has insisted time after time that
they're not questioning Obama's patriotism but merely his judgment, but
McCain's statements are designed to continue building the narrative that
Obama's campaign is about Obama and not America.

****Progressives: No Longer Playing Defense (WaPo 08/27/08)
By E.J. Dionne
The paradox is that there is far less jitteriness about progressive and
liberal ideas. There are many more voters than even four years ago who are
open to what the center left traditionally has stood for. Even more: They
are increasingly resistant to what conservatives have been selling.
Republicans used to be the party with philosophical self-confidence. The
events around this convention suggest that liberals may no longer need
assertiveness training.

Big Labor's Comeback (WSJ 08/27/08)*

The paradox is that even as union numbers have declined, union political

evidence in Denver, where no less than 25% of the 4,200 delegates are activ
e
or retired union members or belong to households with union members. More
significant for the rest of America, labor has won the intellectual battle
for control of the Democratic Party and is reasserting its agenda in a way
not seen since the 1970s.

Sen. Hillary Clinton's speech to Democrats here Tuesday night was arguably
as vital to the party's hopes for winning the White House as Sen. Barack
Obama's big address will be Thursday.  Though Sen. Obama is the Democrats'
nominee, Sen. Clinton is crucial to uniting a party that remains divided
between her supporters and his. Polls show the race with Republican Sen.
John McCain tightening. If Sen. Obama hopes to prevail, he'll need a focuse
d
party, strongly supported by Hillary Clinton.  Last night she quickly set
the tone: "Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now t

unite as a single party with a single purpose," she said. "We are on the
same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines."

Monday night, when Michelle Obama addressed the crowd, Nielsen Co. reported
this afternoon.  If the next three nights continue to draw similar numbers,
this could end up being the most-watched Democratic convention in almost
three decades. In 2015 and 2000, the Democratic conventions averaged about
15.5 million and 15.4 million viewing households respectively, according to
*Nielsen's data <<<link>>>*
.
The most-watched Democratic convention occurred in 1980, when 20.7 million
homes watched Jimmy Carter accept the party's nomination.
