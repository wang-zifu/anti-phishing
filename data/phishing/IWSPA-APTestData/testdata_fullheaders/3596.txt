A Success Message for the New Year

Having trouble viewing this email? click here 

Dear Steven,

I would like to share a success message I received earlier this week from a client – a senior executive from ConAgra Foods, Inc.:




“Anett's coaching sessions were some of the most effective training days in my career. She invested the time to learn about me as an individual and tailor her training to me. Anett's coaching was holistic, personal, and transformative. With her assistance, I've become much more effective in my communication and influence."

With all my best wishes for great success, great satisfaction, and great speaking in the new year.




Sincerely,

Anett D. Grant
President
