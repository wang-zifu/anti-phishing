Steve, first of all, I hope you are well.




Don't know if you remember me, my wife is Araceli and son is Carlo DiGregorio, and he and Bryan were friends at Viewpoint.  I hope life is treating you well.




You might remember that I was a "finance guy".  My last full-time job was CFO at Korn Ferry.  I left there 2 years ago, and now do Board work (I sit on 4 boards) and have become a small business investor for early stage and start-up companies.  One of the things I do is to partner with a good friend in Mexico who is an inventor.  He and I have a patent for sound cancellation that we think is very unique.  We believe that if a major music company gets its hands on it, it could be revolutionary.  Let me know if you or one of your people would like to know more.    




Thanks and Happy Holidays!




Mike DiGregorio
