Re: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 - International

We didnt perform as well as needed over the holidays (Italy, australia, and Spain) so it only happens if China and  France do Turbo numbers which is much higher than the targets we had given until now.   Will be asking a lot (France did $23 with Turbo while Cloudy 1 did only $5m)

Frozen was just too dominant but we had to chase holidays as we are playing so young

Realistically, we are probably $160m to $168m without China.  China probably $10m to $15m
