Dear Partners and Friends,

Our foundation went through a strategic planning process earlier this year 
to assess where we could have the greatest impact on our nation=92s public 
school system in the future.  When we began our work in K-12 education refo
rm in 1999, we believed that urgent, bold reforms were necessary to transfo
rm the status quo into a system that produced dramatically higher student a
chievement.

For more than a decade, the majority of our investments in education philan
thropy has been in the areas of school district governance, management, lab
or relations and competition.  We have been proud to invest in organization
s and leaders that have pursued new ways of tackling the challenges facing 
America=92s public schools.  Our grantees have succeeded in their efforts t
o redesign school districts, draw top talent into the field, and scale up s
uccessful alternative delivery models like high-quality public charter scho
ols.

Although progress has been made, we still have a long way to go before our 
students are internationally competitive in this global economy.  As with a
ny challenge, we are most interested in looking for the next set of promisi
ng ideas, institutions and talent.  For the next three years, our foundatio
n will direct most of our resources toward creating the policies, innovatio
ns, leadership and institutions under which teachers and students can=96and
 do=96succeed.  We will be purposeful, yet opportunistic in the following f
our areas:

Transformative federal and state policy.  We will be expanding our policy w
ork at the federal and state levels.  President Barack Obama and Secretary 
Arne Duncan have created powerful incentives for states and districts to dr
amatically improve American public education.  The success of that work dep
ends on the ability of states to implement courageous, aligned reforms =96 
with deliberate speed and at scale =96 that enable students to perform at s
ignificantly higher levels.  We hope to support federal and state policies 
that remove the barriers to effective K-12 education and create the human c
apital, school choice, resource and governance conditions under which distr
icts and schools can succeed.  We also plan to help state education agencie
s themselves become dynamic, performance-oriented organizations that are re
ady to adopt and implement bold policies.

Groundbreaking innovation in teaching and learning.  We are also excited to
 embark on new investments in innovations that directly serve students and 
teachers.  Technology is a tremendous untapped resource to dramatically inc
rease student learning.  By redefining =93classrooms=94 as we know them, te
chnology can serve to individualize the pace, style and model of instructio
n to meet each and every student=92s needs.  We also look forward to suppor
ting labor organizations with the courage and vision to radically innovate 
collective bargaining in ways that domain.com teachers and students.

Strong leadership.  We are proud that The Broad Center for the Management o
f School Systems has trained more than 300 executives, the majority of whom
 are now working in school districts around the country.  Broad Superintend
ents Academy graduates are raising student achievement faster than their pe
ers after three years in their positions.  And Broad Residents are freeing 
up millions of dollars for the classroom by introducing central office effi
ciencies. 

Redesigned, high-performing institutions.  Finally, redesigned school distr
icts, high-quality public charter schools, Broad Prize districts and altern
ative pathways like Teach For America have one thing in common.  They have 
all adopted or created radically different models that demonstrate it is po
ssible to build high-performing organizations that produce gains for studen
ts.  We look forward to continuing to support these best-in-class instituti
ons and to sharing the tools and practices that will make it faster and eas
ier for new leaders to grow high-performing organizations to scale, without
 wasting a moment reinventing the wheel.

More than a decade ago, when we decided to turn to philanthropy full-time a
nd focus our efforts on K-12 public education reform, we were fortunate to 
have the expertise and leadership of Dan Katzir, who helped build our found
ation=92s education work.  After 11 years leading The Broad Foundation=92s 
education reform work, Dan has decided to change his role to become a part-
time senior advisor to the foundation.  We will always be grateful to Dan f
or his leadership, dedication and commitment.  Dan=92s last day as managing
 director of The Broad Foundation will be Friday, July 23. 

We are again fortunate to have the strong leadership of two of our senior s
taff, who will jointly lead our education reform work.  I am pleased that G
regory McGinity, who has been with our foundation since 2003, will serve as
 managing director of policy, and Rebecca Wolf DiBiase, who has been a core
 member of our grants team since 2006, will be managing director of program
s.  Additionally, we are pleased to announce that Lydia Logan recently join
ed The Broad Foundation as a senior director.  Lydia previously was vice pr
esident and executive director of the Institute for a Competitive Workforce
 at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

As we enter this new chapter in our foundation=92s education work, we are e
very bit as excited and optimistic as we were when we began in 1999.  We lo
ok forward to working with you on this next generation of challenges and op
portunities.
