The problem now is the European distributor and MGM.

He confirmed that will participate in the LA junket 23-25 ​​January and will be arriving in Brazil on January 27, but is in doubt about the trip to Europe on January 30. He said he prefers to continue working in the film Brazil.

We continue working the period January 27-29 for the tour in Brazil.

I think the problems with MGM will be solved, and he goes to Europe as planned. 

Regards.

Rodrigo

Can we enlist your help in getting Jose to understand you need him in to work  Brazil Jan 27-29 . He can arrive on the 26th and leave the 30th . That does not interfere with the junket in LA Jan 23-25 or his European tour Feb 1-6 .
