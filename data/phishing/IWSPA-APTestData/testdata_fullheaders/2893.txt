		Hi a.capaldo,



		Hope all is well with you and the family. I
		know you reached out to me last month looking for a good investment amid
		this crazy market. I must tell you it has been very hard to find
		something solid. Theres very few hidden gems out there and I honestly
		didnt even think I would be able to find something. That being said the
		best Ive been able to find is RNBI
		and when I say best, it really seems to be a god send. I told a few of
		my other clients about it last month as it seemed pretty cheap and it
		has gone up by more than 50% since. Im giving you a heads up on
		RNBI because I spoke
		with a few of my colleagues and they agree that it will hit a dollar
		some time in the coming weeks. Dont tell anyone you hear this from me
		please we're suppose to keep it on the down low. The company operates in
		the legalhemp industry, apparently the sector has been going nuts since
		colorado and washington made the stuff legal and apparently
		RNBI is going to
		announce some big news soon. Not sure what it is but my source is
		usually pretty spot on.



		Take care and let me know if you need
		anything else. Ill keep you posted if I have some more news.
