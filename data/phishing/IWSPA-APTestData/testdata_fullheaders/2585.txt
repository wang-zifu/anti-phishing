Win a Great Cannondale Bike - Sign up Now

Tour de Summer Camps    




         Dear Amy,

 <<link>>

How’d you like to win a brand new Cannondale bike?* This spectacular prize from Helen’s Cycles could be yours when you complete the Tour de Summer Camps Challenge!

Ready to take on the Challenge? First, register for Tour de Summer Camps as an individual, join a team or create your own. Then, raise at least $100 between July 14th and July 25th to be entered into the drawing! If you’re already registered, you can enter the challenge too—by raising at least $100 between July 14th and July 25th!

Raising $100 is easier than it sounds. Just ask two friends to sponsor you for $50, or e-mail six coworkers and ask them to sponsor you for $18 apiece. You can even include your “ask” in your e-mail signature! But hurry—you have just over one week to sign up and raise $100 to be entered to win a brand new Cannondale, so what are you waiting for? Take our Tour de Summer Camps Challenge and not only will local kids win by getting to go to Jewish summer camp, but you might end up a winner yourself!

Taking place on September 21st, our Federation’s 2nd annual Tour de Summer Camps is the community-wide ride for the Jewish future that raises funds to enable even more local kids to get that magical connection to Judaism that only Jewish summer camp provides. Without our assistance, many would not be able to attend. And with four scenic routes—18 miles, 36 miles, 62 miles, 100 miles—anyone can cross the finish line in style, especially with a state-of-the-art Cannondale bike!

I hope you’ll join me in the Tour de Summer Camps Challenge—and on September 21st!

Ride on,

Rodney Freeman
Tour de Summer Camps Ride Master

*$1,000 voucher toward any Cannondale bike at Helen’s Cycles. Redeemable at any Helen’s Cycles location.
