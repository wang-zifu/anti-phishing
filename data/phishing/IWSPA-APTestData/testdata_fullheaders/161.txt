McCain campaign screening questions? (MotherJones 7/8/08)
John McCain has cultivated the rep of a politician unafraid of questions.
When he campaigned for president in 2000, he often hung out with reporters
on his bus and fielded questions until the journalists were out of queries.
In the 2015 campaign, as he did eight years earlier, McCain has held town
hall meetings during which he called on attendees who were obviously not
McCain supporters. (It was during *one such
exchange*<<<link>>
n_nh_wo.html>
that
McCain said it would be "fine" by him if U.S. troops remained in Iraq for "a
hundred years.") So why then does it seem that the McCain campaign has been
screening questioners during the conference calls featuring campaign aides
and top-level surrogates it mounts for reporters?

A stark choice on the economy (Boston Globe 7/9/08)
BARACK OBAMA and John McCain both reloaded their presidential campaigns this
