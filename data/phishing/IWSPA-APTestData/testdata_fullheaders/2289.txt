I'll talk to Jon, but we might ask if the Sunni and Shia will put down their
guns so the President has time to work on the financial crisis.  The fact is
- no the world doesn't let the president take a time-out from everything
else, and a Presidential candidate must prove he or she can handle a number
of crises and issues at once, and if they find that too hard, maybe they
shouldn't be running for President.




Depends on what Obama says, I guess.

"Perhaps John McCain is suspending his campaign because all his staff,
advisors, and fundraisers have raced back to their day jobs in Washington --
lobbying for Wall Street," said David Donnelly, Director of Campaign Money
Watch.
