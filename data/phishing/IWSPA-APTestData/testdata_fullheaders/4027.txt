Marketplace Safety
                                Tip 

Always remember to complete your
                                transaction on eBay - it's the safer way to
                                trade. 

Is this message an offer to
                                buy your item directly through email without
                                winning the item on eBay? If so, please help
                                make the eBay marketplace safer by reporting it
                                to us. These "outside-of-eBay" transactions may
                                be unsafe and are against eBay policy. Learn
                                more about selling with
                                confidence. 

Use good
                                judgement when accepting checks or money orders
                                as payment for high value items.

Before shipping the goods, check
                                with your bank to ensure that the payment method
                                is valid, and that funds have cleared and are
                                available. 

If this email
                                is inappropriate or violates eBay policy, please
                                help protect other eBay community members by
                                reporting it
