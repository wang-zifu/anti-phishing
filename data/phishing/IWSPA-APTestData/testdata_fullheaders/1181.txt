Hey Team,

As you may have heard there will be an action happening tomorrow starting here at the Organizationand ending at the WH around the raids that the administration announced last week:

*         Time: 10:00 AM

(rallying in front of the Organizationthen moving at 10:50 to ICE HQ 500 12th St Expy, then at 11:40 AM head to the final destination at the White House)

*         Turnout: 50-100

*         Lead by CASA

Not sure the protocol for when things like this happen.  I clearly know the group and can reach out to them, but wanted to know the protocol before I call them.
Thank you,
Bridgette
