LA Times just notified me that they will no longer be able to interview DWS. As such, found a replacement for that time slot. Variety's Ted Johnson will now be interviewing her, and User has ok'd. Briefing attached. Will be updated travel sketch shortly too.

Since I just secured the LA Times interview, drafted a memo for that too, which is identical to the LA Daily News one.

Attached all three memos here so we can have in one place.

Thx.
