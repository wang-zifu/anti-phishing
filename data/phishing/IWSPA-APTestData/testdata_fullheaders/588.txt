John,

I could not be more thrilled that after 22 years of love and partnership, 
my friend Sean Maloney is marrying his partner Randy Florke this Saturday.

Since their first meeting at a New York City disco in 1992, Sean and Randy 
have supported each other's remarkable career ambitions and deep 
dedication to parenting three amazing children - Reiniel, Daley and Essie.

I know that your support means so much to Sean, and I would love to 
present him and Randy with a guest book on their wedding day, full of your 
names and well wishes.

Will you join me in signing the guest book?

Click here to sign the guest book and congratulate Sean and Randy. We will 
print it to present to the happy couple after the wedding Saturday.

Having stood side-by-side with Sean on issues that matter, I can hardly 
domain.com for him to take the most meaningful stand of his life.

Not only does this wedding formally recognize the partnership of two 
incredibly devoted people - something their kids have been eager to see - 
but it also celebrates the growth of our country, toward recognizing every 
love and every family.

Thanks for taking a moment to sign the guest book. I know Sean and Randy 
will be honored.
