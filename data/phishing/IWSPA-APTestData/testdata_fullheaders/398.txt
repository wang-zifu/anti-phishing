Dear Law Center community,

I'm writing to inform you that after six years of loyal service, Paola Maru
gan is leaving the Law Center. She has accepted a terrific opportunity with
 the Pan American Health Organization. Her last day is tomorrow, November 8
. Saturday may seem like an odd day for a final work day, but it coincides 
with the National Security Crisis Law Simulation. This experiential learnin
g exercise has been held once or twice a year since 2015 and requires the r
esources of all the IST units as well as Special Events and Facilities Mana
gement. In addition to her SharePoint responsibilities, Paola has ably serv
ed as the project manager for every Simulation.

As the senior SharePoint developer in the IST Department, Paola was in the 
unique and challenging position of not being able to consult with her colle
agues for help and advice. She accepted this challenge =96 and every projec
t that came her way =96 with a consistently positive attitude. She took her
 responsibilities very seriously and often worked nights and weekends to fu
lfill them.

I=92m grateful to have had someone as dedicated and diligent as Paola as a 
member of the IST team. Please join me in wishing her well in her next ende
avor.
