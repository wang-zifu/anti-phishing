Hello, Mr. user.

Bill Martens here, one of the producers of the Joy Cardin Show on Wisconsin
 Public Radio, our live morning-drive call-in program.  I caught a couple o
f news stories about your biggest regret being that you didn't get the UFO 
files released.

<<link>>
sure_n_6699646.html

Any chance you might be willing to join us by phone this Fri., Feb. 20 from
 8-9 a.m. EST (7-8 a.m. CST) to discuss this issue?  This would consist of 
questions from our fill-in host, John Munson, and calls/emails from listene
rs.  We'd be looking at the full hour, minus a few minutes off the top for 
news and a couple of shorter breaks at 8:20 and 8:40.

We can talk about why the matter isn't being taken seriously, what it might
 take to get to that point, and ultimately what we should be doing to get t
o the bottom of UFOs and aliens.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience whether you can help us out
 and thanks for your consideration!
