actually, this is not the whole 2O pager roadmap but an example of the type
 of public outreach, both Congressional and interest groups, that the teams
 would envision doing and lay out in there roadmaps.  This highlights the n
eed to make sure we have a centrallized congressional outreach and public l
iaison function soon after the election to coordinate this outreach.

John,

Here is an example of a pre-election 20 pager -- the roadmap for the team g
oing into the agency post election.  Let us know if you have any thoughts o
r suggestions as we have a working group meeting on Tuesday and the teams a
re preparing these now.

Thanks,
Lisa
