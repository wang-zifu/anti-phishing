Dear PayPal Member,

We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto

your PayPal account, and multiple password failures were present before

the logins. We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us.

If this is not completed by December 07, 2008, we will be forced to suspend

your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.

We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. To confirm your Account

records click on the following link:
