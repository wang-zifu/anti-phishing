Hello John,

We have been talking internally and now with the Roosevelt Institute about 
ideas for next year and influencing the economic debate as we head into the
 2015 campaign. One idea that we've had is to work towards some type of can
didate forum where we get at policies where we frame the questions to get a
t how equitable growth could work in practice.

I wanted to check in with you and hear your reaction and brainstorm a bit, 
if you have time. Good/bad idea in general? Do you think it would be possib
le to do in a c3 way - I.e., with both D and R candidates - where the candi
dates would actually want to engage?

Steve Daetz is stopping by Monday for lunch at the office (in our new space
 on the first floor!) and I don't want to bring this up unless you and I ha
ve had a chance to talk beforehand.

Thanks!
Heather
