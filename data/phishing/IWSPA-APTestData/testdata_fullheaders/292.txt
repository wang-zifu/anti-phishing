OFFICE CLOSURE - UK - MONDAY 5-5 FOR A *BANK HOLIDAY

*Bank holidays give a chance to the family to spend some precious time together, so make sure it is relaxing and memorable by taking a short break or longer holiday with the family. It is also a time that friends can get together and catch up, so rent a beautiful large property in the country where you can open the wine and have a good old gossip (lol).
