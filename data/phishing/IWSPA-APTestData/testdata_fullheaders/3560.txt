A lot of you probably have heard of the Minnesota State Fair. Chocolate
covered bacon on a stick, the butter sculpture, all you can drink milk for
$1, and cheese curds.....hmmmm.....cheese curds....

Anyhoo, a couple days ago things got stupid. The MN GOP is hosting a contest
-- giving $2,500 to whomever waits in line the longest at their booth. They
say it's good practice for Obama Care (GET IT? HILARIOUS RIGHT?)

My fantastic staff came up with an idea of showing how dumb this is, by
doing a little math -- showing how much health insurance companies are
making in profits during that same time, how much money they're spending on
lobbying during that same time and how many people are losing health
insurance at the same time. You can read Joe's post about it here:

<<link>>

We are looking for: lots of link love -- blow up how dumb this is, please.
Also, any other stats we should include? We're doing a daily media
email/tweet campaign/blog update with the new numbers as a way to keep it
going, but thought you all might have some other ideas. you can email me, or
joe (ccd' on this).

We'll let you know if anything else comes of it. Enjoy the rest of summer,

Denise Cardinal
