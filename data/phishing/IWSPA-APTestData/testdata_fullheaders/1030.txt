You are wrong on both counts. Explanation is valid for symmetrical TCP, for
others see explanations below.

You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or
preventive delay.

ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching
the edge router's domain.com interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO
ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not domain.com for the link to be at or near saturation
to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive.

It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow
basis) to accommodate WAN link speed domain.com and current network utilization,
rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds,
eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to
slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed
threshold (90%?).

Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard
of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets
after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it?

Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic

It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees
the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the
LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them).
If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically,
in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and
the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the
tunnel whereas the domain.com at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows
full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends.

UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing
packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station
on the LAN) are handled differently.

For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving
device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the
receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow
the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available.

For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops
only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion,
which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts.

ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped.

queueing on

The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the
state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its
TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is
congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the
"speed domain.com to obey" for every connection (based on policies and network
conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may
not be as "tight" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work.

Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate
control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating
with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming
congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If
there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot
longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second. Do
you agree?
