Relocation/Construction - A Thought

Hi Michael, Amy, and Doug,




Thank you so much for taking the time yesterday to brief us on the relocation strategy.  Everyone really appreciates the updates.  I did have a thought about the new building’s potential impact to the lot’s culture.  My only concern is that by creating a fully fleshed out West Campus (with a Coffee Bean, park, and commissary), that folks on that side will have little reason to venture over to Main Street and Calley Park.  I love our campus feel and love bumping into people from different divisions.  By creating a West Campus, I fear we may inadvertently be segmenting the lot into two separate self-sufficient mini lots, thus removing the idea of a central communal space.  




To minimize this divide, here are a few simple suggestions on how we could keep a nice friendly flow between East and West:




·         Ensure that Thursday happy hour in always hosted in 1x location vs. having 2x competing happy hours happening simultaneously.  

·         Encourage each commissary to feature distinct menus so that each side has incentive to venture to the other depending on the meals of the day.

·         Maintain Jimmy Stewart screening rooms so we have a variety of location options for lot screenings and/or friends & family research screenings.

·         House film memorabilia and props within the new space to give studio tours and curious employees a reason to explore the West Campus.




I know this probably ranks low on the priorities list, but just wanted to share this thought in hopes that we can retain a unified culture regardless of physical location.




Thank you for your time!




Alex Andujar
