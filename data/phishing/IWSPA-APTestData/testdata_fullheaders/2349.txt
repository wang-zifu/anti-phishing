John,

Thank you for all of your help with this year's Annual Meeting. As always, 
we are grateful for your involvement.

We are now scheduling debrief calls with key meeting participants and advis
ors. I would welcome the opportunity to include you in this process, if you
 are interested. Specifically, we are interested in any thoughts or observa
tions you wish to share and any recommendations you have for next year.

Please let me know if you would like to find any time to talk, or meet if y
ou're headed back to NYC in the near future. I would be happy to talk at yo
ur convenience.

Until then, thank you and all the best,

Ed
