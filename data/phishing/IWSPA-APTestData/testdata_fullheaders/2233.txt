Hi, Mark emailed user@domain.com last night with an important email and it never went through. Can someone please check and see what happened to the email? He sent it at 7:29pm. We no longer need it to go out because we have to change the day of the event it was advertising now, so if it's in holding, please cancel it. But we will need to email the list asap. Thanks!
