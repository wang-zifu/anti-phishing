All: backing up Eric here. Interviews, op-ends, LTEs are all great. (Press 
release don't matter unless they are pitched and placed.) But those are sec
ondary. The assignment and goal is events that will generate multiple hits.
 I'm not going to be able to get all 7 of my states to do them but I'm hopi
ng at least 3 or 4 will. Two are happening tomorrow. Please push harder to 
your states for events. The hook can be tweaked to be state specific, doesn
't have to be exactly what we put in the packet. The other things like inte
rviews and op-eds are nice to haves but secondary options. This is importan
t to gauge the abilities of our state parties to deploy surrogates and host
 pressers quickly.
