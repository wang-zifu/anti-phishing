Hi Brian, I'm connecting you with Gus Arnavat, who served in the Obama Administration as the Executive Director for the United States on the Inter-American Development Bank, and was heavily involved as a donor and helping raise campaign money in 2015 and 2012. He is working with a group of Ambassadors who want to be in Philadelphia and coordinate their own event. I suggested to him that he should be in touch with you, at a minimum to get a good lay of the land or potentially coordinate with you.

Gus, Brian is an old friend who served both at the Organizationduring my last stint here and in the Administration, and now runs public engagement for the Convention. I leave you both in good hands.
