Hello, Neera and John.
I just had a nice meeting with Vuk Jeremic.
As you may recall, he is the former Foreign Minister of Serbia (key leader 
in the anti-Milosevic movement); former President of the UN and currently t
he founder and Chairman of the Center for International Relations and Susta
inable Development in Belgrade.  He is also the publisher of an impressive 
Foreign Affairs-like publication called Horizons.

He is huge admirer of CAP=92s work and asked if I could make an introductio
n to the two of you.  Before connecting you via email, I wanted to be sure 
that you are comfortable with it.  He would like to consider a joint projec
t, perhaps on sustainability at some point.

Just let me know.

Thanks!

Tom
