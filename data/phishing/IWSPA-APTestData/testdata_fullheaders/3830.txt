 Confirm Your 
                        Bank Account

This is a reminder that we need you 
                  to confirm your bank account. This bank account was added to 
                  your PayPal account and will be end in 17/06/2005.

How To Confirm Your Bank 
                              Account

PayPal has made two small deposits into 
                        the bank account you registered. These deposits 
                        should appear in your bank account in 2-4 business 
                      days.

Step 
                        1:  Call your bank, use your ATM 
                        statement, or go to your online bank account to find out 
                        what the exact amounts of these two deposits are. 
                        You can also check your paper bank statement for these 
                        amounts. They will be listed as deposits from 
                    PayPal.

Step 
                        2:  Go to
                        <> log in to your PayPal 
account. 
                        Complecte your "Bank Account" information and "Activate 
Account".

Why Confirm Your Bank 
                              Account?

It increases security
When 
                        you enter the two amounts that PayPal deposited into 
                        your bank account, you confirm that you are the owner of 
                        this bank account. This is because only you as the owner 
                        would have access to the exact amounts of the 2 deposits 
                        PayPal sent. This process increases the safety of the 
                        entire PayPal payments network.

Your PayPal account will become 
                        verified
Your PayPal account becomes verified 
                        once you confirm your bank account. With a verified 
                        account, there is no domain.com on the amount of money you 
                        can send through PayPal when you choose to make these 
                        payments using funds from your bank account.

Your $2,000.00 USD sending domain.com 
                        will be removed
Once you confirm your bank 
                        account, your sending domain.com will be lifted and there 
                        will be no domain.com on the amount of money you can send 
                        through PayPal using your bank account 
                    funds.

Protect Your 
                          Password

Never give your password 
                        to anyone and only log in at 
                        <> . If anyone 
                        asks for your password, please follow the Security Tips instructions 
on the 
                        PayPal website.
