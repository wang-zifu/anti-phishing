the Iran Treaty. There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter
Faith orgs including the ability to reach so me working class voters,

Hi Diane,

     I wanted you to see this report from our Exec. Dir. Chris Hale.

     We are going to seek a meeting with Warner, and requests are in the
works for Coons and Casey.

                       Best wishes,

                                        Ben

Dear friends and colleagues,

Good morning! Let me apologize in advance for a lengthy e-mail. If you
don't have time to read the whole thing, I've bolded the important points.

   1. *Our advertisement began running on National Catholic Reporter and
   Commonweal yesterday. Right* now, when you click the advertisement, the
   link takes you to MoveOn's 60 Day to Stop A War Take Action website
   <<<link>>>. From there, you are able to dial
   into your Member of Congress and request them to support the Iran Deal.

   At some point today, that link will change to our own website, which
   will list all the groups' names, simple talking points, and give people 
a
   chance to dial in three elected officials (their one US Representatives 
and
   two Senators). While the MoveOn site is very effective, ours will ensure
   that people calling into the offices identify as a person of faith, whic
h
   is important in both our narrative creation (Catholics support the deal)
   and coalition building (the God Squad takes action).

   We will have a good data metric in the next few days about how the
   advertisement is doing.
   2. *The letters to both Senators Cardin and Mikulski have been e-mailed,
   faxed, and snail mailed to the appropriate parties.* This morning, I
   will make follow up calls to the state chief of staffs and schedulers. I
   imagine we'll know early next week if they plan on meeting with our grou
ps'
   representatives. If it appears that isn't the case, I'm developing a
   grass-tops digital strategy and local media strategy to encourage them t
o
   change their minds. This will hopefully only boost the great work and
   meetings made possible by the work of Bob, Marie D, Marie L, Ben, and
   others.
   3.
*On that note, I have phone calls early next week with senior advocacy
   staffers for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, Archdiocese of Washington (wh
ich
   includes territory in Maryland), and the Maryland Catholic Conference.  
*
   While I think there should be many goals for these meetings, I think the
   top-line goal is pretty clear: we need Archbishop William Lori and Cardi
nal
   Donald Wuerl to make direct appeals to Senators Cardin and Mikulski on t
his
   issue. While I don't have any advance knowledge, I have a sense from the
   conversations setting up the meetings that there might be willingness fo
r
   that to happen.
   4. *I will be sending an additional e-mail to our C4 community on
   Tuesday to asking them to contact their Members of Congress. *This was
   remarkably successful last week. Based on the digital metrics, we can
   safely assume thousands of our Catholic brothers and sisters are taking
   action on this issue. My colleagues will be working with our allies to s
can
   the local newspapers this upcoming week to see if people are communicati
ng
   faith values in supporting the deal to letters to the editors in newspap
ers
   across the nation. My initial sense is that they are. That would be
   something to be proud of for our group.
   5. *I'll be taking some time off on both today and Monday to rejuvenate
   myself as my colleagues and I continue our grueling preparation for Pope
   Francis's apostolic trip to the US. *As you can imagine, Iran is just a
   portion of the work we're doing in preparation for the Holy Father's tri
p.

   From Friday afternoon until Monday morning (the traditional weekend),
   I'll be on retreat and won't be accessible by phone or e-mail. However, 
you
   can reach me today and Monday through my colleagues (CC'd here) who know
   how to get a hold of me.
   6. *Thank you for being patient with me as I attempt to navigate the
   unified, but--at times--diverse hopes and expectations of the group. *I
   will continue to try to balance the goals and needs of the group with th
e
   pressure to move the ball forward with the clock winding down in the fou
rth
   quarter of this important effort. I spoke to the White House yesterday a
nd
   they assure us the media's moniker calling us "God Squad" isn't just swe
et
   nothings, but actually a fair assessment of the substantial difference
   we're making in this conversation.

Thank you again for all your hard work and continued support. And if you
get a chance, please pray for me and my colleagues as we enter into some
needed rest this weekend!
