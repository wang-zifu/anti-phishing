Jennifer I would have loved to join, but I have a meeting with NALEO at 1:15pm at their office.  As soon as I am done and back in the office I can join.

Best,
Bridgette

Hello all -
Felix Sanchez, Julie Anbender, and Carlo Castilla (National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts) and I are meeting to develop a game plan for Hispanic A-List Surrogates. We're scheduled to meet at 1:30-3:30PM Friday, May 13.
Are you available to meet with us? Raul will be out of town.
Thanks in advance for your input.
