New TV Ad: Rep. Michele Bachmann Voted to Deny Minnesotans Access to the Sa

Washington DC - As part of a major, coalitional advertising and grassroots 
effort from pro-health insurance reform forces<<<link>>
domain.com/site/content/on_our_side_release> spotlighting where Members of Cong
ress stood during the historic passage of the Patient Protection and Afford
able Care Act<<<link>>> in the
 U.S. House of Representatives Sunday night, Americans United for Change un
veiled a new television ad criticizing Michele Bachmann's (MN-6) vote to de
ny Minnesotans access to the same insurance choices she enjoys as a Member 
of Congress. See script below for "Good Enough for Her" which will air in t
he Twin Cities media market starting on Tuesday with more than $100,000 beh
ind the effort.

In addition, Americans United launched more than 700,000 robocalls in the f
ollowing districts today with a similar message (see script below):  Roy Bl
unt (MO-7), Charles Dent (PA-15), Joseph Cao (LA-2), Parker Griffith (AL-5)
, Daniel Lungren (CA-3), Mary Bono (CA-45), Mark Kirk (IL-10), Lee Terry (N
E-2), Jean Schmidt (OH-2), Pat Tiberi (OH-12), Jim Gerlach (PA-6), David Re
ichert (WA-8).

Tom McMahon, Acting Executive Director, Americans United for Change: "In a 
monumental victory for average Americans over powerful special interests, S
unday's vote in the U.S. House put comprehensive and long overdue health in
surance reform on a clear path to the President's desk -- reform that will 
usher in a new era of accountability for the insurance industry and ensure 
all Americans access to the quality and affordable health care they deserve
. With 32 million Americans poised to gain coverage that many avoided neces
sary treatment without, and with all Americans poised to gain piece of mind
 that the insurance companies can't exclude them for pre-existing condition
s or drop them if they get sick, this is a moment every bit as historic as 
the passage of Social Security and Medicare in the 20th Century.

"And just like Social Security or Medicare or civil rights, those like Cong
resswoman Michele Bachmann who voted to protect the status quo will find th
emselves on the wrong side of history," continued McMahon. "On this day, ho
wever, Congressional Republicans seem very proud of themselves for voting t
o protect the profits of insurance companies that see nothing wrong with ra
ising premiums as high as 75 percent.  They're patting themselves on the ba
ck for siding with the big insurance companies over their constituents that
 went bankrupt<<<link>>
bankruptcy-on-rise-medical-debt-medical-bills-how-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html>
 after they got sick and saw their coverage rescinded.  These Republicans m
ade a different kind of history today by voting to deny giving the struggli
ng families they represent access to the same kind of insurance they enjoy 
very much as members of Congress.  If it's good enough for them, shouldn't 
it be good enough for their constituents?

"When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is ultimately signed i
nto law, it will be interesting to see if these Republicans will campaign o
n a promise to repeal it and effectively strip 32 million Americans of thei
r health coverage, roll back the ban on lifetime and annual insurance caps,
 restore the 'donut hole' prescription drug coverage gap for seniors, kick 
young adults from their parents' policies, take back the tax credits issued
 to families and small businesses in their districts, take the nation off a
 path towards reducing the domain.com by $1.2 trillion<<<link>>
domain.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/18/AR2010031801153_pf.html>, and undo
 the sweeping new protections for all Americans from the worst insurance in
dustry practices."

SCRIPT: "Good Enough For Her"

Finally, Congress passed the health reform bill to reign in the power of th
e big insurance companies and guarantee that all Minnesotans can get the sa
me kind of health insurance as members of congress.

But our Congresswoman Michele Bachmann voted against that.

She may think she's an "important" politician in Washington,

... but when it comes to health insurance, if it's good enough for her... s
houldn't it be good enough for the rest of us?

Call Michele Bachmann at 320-253-5931 or at 651-731-5400

Robocall script:

Last weekend, Congress passed the health reform bill to reign in the power 
of the big insurance companies and guarantee that regular people can get th
e same kind of insurance as members of congress.

But Congressman ____________vote against that.

Call Congressman___________at _______________.  Ask him (her) why if his he
alth insurance is good enough for him, shouldn't it be good enough for the 
rest of us.
