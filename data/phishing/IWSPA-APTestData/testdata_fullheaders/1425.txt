Something anti-LGBT just happened in the House moments ago, reporters are tweeting it. Republicans defeated an amendment offered by Sean Maloney that would have stripped anti-LGBT language out of the NDAA. It was going to pass and then a few Republicans actually switched their vote to make it lose. Apparently Democrats hissed "Shame on you" on the House floor.

I think we need to put out a short statement chiding them. Copying Ryan because I would imagine that DWS congressional side knows more about this and may already be working on something. Can we make this a chair statement?
