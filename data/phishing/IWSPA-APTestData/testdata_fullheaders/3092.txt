I=92d love to know more about the specific goals of the Center.. I agree 
this is a growing problem in the U.S., but not sure what the proposed 
answer is other than access to higher education for all, and higher 
taxes on the wealthy.

I remember a few years ago, CAP hosted a speaker who talked about how 
America is becoming a =93winner take all=94 society, and I think that is 
exponentially true today. 

Washington Center for Equitable Growth, housed at the Center for 
American Progress. I will serve as Equitable Growth=92s Special Projects 
Coordinator=97indeed, John=92s calendar is a special project, so please 
do keep contacting me for all scheduling requests, media inquiries, etc. 
 Also feel free to forward this note to any who ask for it.

that to the world, if you have it, please feel free to keep using it.  
If you require it for personal matters, let me know.

for a much needed Caribbean cruise, and it turns out wi-fi is pretty 
darn expensive (and I=92ll be honest, I=92d rather overpay for a virgin 
margarita).  So I won=92t be in good communication at all from Mon 2/23 
through Saturday morning 2/28.  I will be in the office Sunday Mar 1 
playing catch up.  If you have an engagement or a call with John in the 
coming week, then I have already provided you or your office with a 
direct way to reach him if you have any concerns or changes.
