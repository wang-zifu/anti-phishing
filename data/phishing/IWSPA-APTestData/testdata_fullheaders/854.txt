Friend,

I love Halloween, but this is actually scary =2E=2E=2E

In less than a week, Bruce Rauner could be the governor-elect of Illino
is=2E

If that happens, you can forget about raising the minimum wage, and bra
ce yourself for devastating cuts to education and services=2E

That's my nightmare=2E

This race is a coin toss right now -- but we're not leaving it to chanc
e=2E

For the next five days, we're going to do everything we can to prevent 
that nightmare from becoming real=2E

Tonight is the last fundraising deadline of this campaign=2E That means
 you can do something about it right now=2E

Chip in $5 or more before the clock strikes midnight:
