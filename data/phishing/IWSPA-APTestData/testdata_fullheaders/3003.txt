In light of the Chamber's unflattering close-up<<<link>>
om/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/15/AR2009111503159.html> this morning, I 
wanted to make sure you saw this new breakdown of political contributions f
rom its board members from ThinkProgress -- which shows that fully 88% of t
heir political contributions go to either Republicans or big corporation.

The Board Of The 'Voice Of Business' Is A Republican Money Machine<<<link>>
domain.com/2009/11/14/chamber-of-gop/>

<<link>>

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which purports to be "the voice of business<h
ttp://domain.com/about/default.htm>," is run by a Republican money machi
ne. As the nation's largest lobbying shop, the Chamber is spending millions
 of dollars from its corporate members against President Obama's progressiv
e agenda of health care<<<link>>
477-us-chamber-employers-oppose-house-healthcare-bill>, energy<<<link>>
domain.com/2009/08/25/chamber-scopes-climate-trial/>, and financ
ial reform<<<link>>>. The 
Chamber claims that the "board's membership is as diverse as the nation's b
usiness community<<<link>>> itself," bu
t this is false. A ThinkProgress analysis of federal election contribution 
data compiled by the LittleSis project<<<link>>
/following-the-chamber-money-trail-part-1/> has found that the Chamber's 11
6-member board of directors<<<link>>>ha
s given more than six times as much money to Republican candidates and comm
ittees ($4,741,747) as it has to Democrats ($778,282), with $1,074,697 flow
ing to corporate political action committees:

The top beneficiary of this outpouring of conservative cash is the Republic
an National Committee, which has received over ten times as much money from
 the Chamber's board as the Organization - $1,257,201 vers
us $102,950. Contributions went 4.5 to 1 for John McCain ($373,150) versus 
Barack Obama ($82,150).

Of the board's 116 members, 96 have made major political contributions. Six
ty-eight directly contributed to the campaigns of George W. Bush or John Mc
Cain. In contrast, only 27 gave to the campaigns of Al Gore, John Kerry, or
 Barack Obama. Forty-seven board members, including Chamber of Commerce pre
sident Tom Donohue<<<link>>
ge/>, have contributed more than 90 percent to Republicans, averaging $74,6
34 in GOP contributions. Only seven members have contributed more than 90 p
ercent to Democrats, averaging $3,529 to Democrats.

The political giving is dominated by leading Republican billionaire George 
Argyros<<<link>>
/>, the Bush pioneer who served a disastrous term as the U.S. ambassador to
 Spain. Argyros is also one of the top backers of Newt Gingrich's right-win
g American Solutions for Winning the Future. The following visualization of
 Chamber of Commerce board member contributions<<<link>>

urrounding a few small islands of blue. The size of each box is proportiona
l to amount of total contributions per person, with the shading indicating 
percentage of Republican versus Democratic contributions:
