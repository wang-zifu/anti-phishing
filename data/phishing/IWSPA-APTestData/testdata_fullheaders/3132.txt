We're not in disagreement on this. Happy to save us the trouble of having to meet. When I ok'd the tweet TJ was supposed to run it through the usual process, just like when I approve a press release it still goes to RR2. Ultimately Comm can still override thematic changes, but we definitely want the substance to be right. The only issue yesterday was I didn't see a reason to get into it in a big group setting, and to Cate's domain.com she was poised and professional as usual. But yes, I'll reiterate to my team to continue to run everything we do through the same process.

Thanks.
