John --

I'll get right to the point. We're closing the books on this
quarter in just a few hours.

So this is it -- chip in $5, or whatever you can, right now
and help support OFA's work.

It's been a major year for this movement, but President
Obama has 13 months left in office, and there's still more
work to do. I believe in this work, damn it -- and I know
you do too.

Chip in whatever you can right now:

Thanks
