FW: [domain.com] Focus Makes $20 Million P&A Deal For River Road, Participant And Lionsgate Intl-Funded Juan Antonio Bayona-Helmed 'A Monster Calls'

I had domain.com at 10.    What is interesting is how much greater universal’s valuation of spain was than the numbers I got from our guys.  Part of the larger convo we are having. 




Also, interesting and a significant development in the director driven project world, is the stuff about caa internal packaging control.   They are demanding and getting fees now on these from the financiers (they call it a “packaging fee”) and are keeping as many emerging high end filmmaker projects off the market until they have full control.  It’s the MRC game and its spreading fast.   Kind of like the old CAA Ovitz play when stars mattered in the 80s. 

What I personally believe this means for Studios is a need to double down on development spending, targeted at “go” talent elements, or we will lose control over our destiny.
