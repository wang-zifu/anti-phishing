I've let CNN know this doesn't work for this week. But let's look at the possibility for next week.

Hi Pablo,
I wanted to check back and see if you received my interview request for Debbie Wasserman Schultz yesterday.
I'm a producer for CNN anchor Michael Smerconish, host of the Saturday 9am political show, SMERCONISH.
We would love to have the OrganizationChair as a guest on our show to discuss the Democratic presidential race and Republican rival Donald Trump.
Would Ms. Wasserman Schultz be able to join us this Saturday at 9am ET? (We could do this from DC or Florida).
If Saturday is not an option, would she be able to tape tomorrow afternoon sometime between 3p and 6p ET?
Sincerely,
Corinna
