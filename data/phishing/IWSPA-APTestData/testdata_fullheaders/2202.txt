Dear Paul,

Greetings from Tokyo.  I have been in Asia since early Wednesday.  Out of
the country for the very exciting election results though I could watch the
returns in the morning in Singapore.  Great that you carried Florida!

I have been thinking about the Geithner-Summers choice, if that is indeed
the choice, and feel compelled to share my thoughts with someone in
authority.

Larry =96 I have known Larry for more than 20 years, worked with him at the
Federal Reserve and Treasury, and was supportive of him during the agony at
Harvard.  Of course he is super talented to the extent that he can do
anything he puts his mind to do and maybe do better at it than most of the
rest of the people in the world when he is operating at 50% efficiency.   I
am very concerned, however, at a personal level.  My sense is that for
people on top you cannot very easily go back to where you were.  It takes a
special mind set.  The Treasury on 1/20/09 will not be like Larry left it o
n
1/19/01.  This will frustrate Larry and diminish his effectiveness.  I can
report that the career staff is already concerned about Larry's return.  He
is very high maintenance.

Tim =96 You know I am a big fan of his and my enthusiasm was not misplaced.
Yes, if he were appointed, he would leave another hole at the FRBNY, and th
e
record of quick appointments there is not great.  But he is almost ideal fo
r
the job given his experience at the FRBNY on top of at the IMF and the UST.
Of course, he would hit the ground running. You know better than I, but my
sense is that everyone in NY AND around the world has great confidence in
Tim and, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Larry.  The career
Treasury staff would love the return of Tim almost to a person, which may
not be all that relevant.  It is relevant that Tim is both an independent
thinker and a team player, which is what we need now.

Best

Ted
