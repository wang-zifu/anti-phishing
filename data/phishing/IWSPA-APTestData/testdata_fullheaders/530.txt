RE: I'd value your feedback on a new technology news service we're working on...

Hello again,

Have you had time to look at GenNews yet?

This is a prototype technology news service we've developed and which we are hoping to launch later this year.

I appreciate that you're busy and that surveys like this are never a priority, but if you are an active user of technology news services then you'll find this interesting - and I'd really value your feedback.

Could you spare 10mins or so to take a look? If so then here's a link to the micro site:

GenNews Prototype

Best regards,
Andrew

Hi,

We're planning to launch a free technology news service later in 2014, and I'd like to know what you think of a functional prototype we've developed...

The project name for this new service is GenNews.

GenNews is a free news service covering the global technology industry that aggregates news content from 1,500 sources, 30 countries and 80 technology markets.

Compared with other technology news services, GenNews offers 9 benefits:

Create personalised news channels: create customised news channels by choosing from 80 tech markets, 30 countries and 1,500 sources;

Global news coverage: find out about developments in the countries that are important to you;

Translation into English: local news content is translated into English;

Save important news: save time and increase efficiency by copying important news to your news clipboard;

Advanced search: filter searches by choosing the date, countries, markets and sources;

Read related research for free: Related data, company profiles and forecasts are attached to news items;

Original news content only: avoid low value-added, derivative news content - GenNews only contains source press releases;

No intrusive ads: avoid ads that degrade your reading experience.

Read important news rarely found elsewhere: GenNews carries items you're unlikely to find on other tech news services.

Click here to try a prototype of GenNews...

BUT - before you dive in, please remember to complete the feedback form which is visible at the top of each page. If you complete the feedback form then I'll email you with the results of the survey.

If the overall feedback is good enough, we'll develop GenNews into a commercial service which will be launched later in 2014.

Thanks for your interest.
