Techs rise, but Dow falls on day of Bush speech
Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.

Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors.

Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P; 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.

C.S. First Boston expects an upbeat outlook from Intel in tech notes 7/15/02 
Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms. Mahon reiterates a "buy" rating on Intel.INTEL CORP 19.12 6.28%
