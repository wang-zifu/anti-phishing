The Agency Nominated For
18th Annual Webby Award!

Online Voting Underway

The Agency is thrilled to announce it has been selected by the International Academy of Digital Arts & Sciences as a 2015 Webby Award nominee! It is one of only 5 real estate companies selected for this prestigious honor, chosen from among 12,000 entries submitted from all 50 states and more than 60 countries. All Webby Winners will be announced on April 29 and honored at the 18th Annual Webby Awards, hosted by Patton Oswalt at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City this May.

The Webby Awards are presented annually to recognize the best of the best in online innovation and creativity; they are to websites what the Oscars, Grammys and Emmys are to their industries. Public online voting, for the People’s Voice Award, is now underway, and we'd greatly appreciate a few seconds of your time to cast a vote for The Agency.

Zillow has won both the Webby and the People’s Voice Award two years running. Help The Agency come out on top this year and get out the vote!




Thanks in advance for voting for The Agency. Your support is always greatly appreciated.
