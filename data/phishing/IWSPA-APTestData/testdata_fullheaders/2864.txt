 <<link>> Buy an Extended Auto Warranty

The newer and more sophisticated cars are becoming increasingly more expensive to fix. The average cost to repair an air conditioning system for example is $825. Over the next five years repair costs are going to increase about 12% per year.

That $850 air conditioner repair today could cost as much as $1,500 to repair when it breaks five years from now. One covered repair can pay for the entire warranty and you are buying tomorrow’s repairs at today’s prices.
