Republicans head to the polls in South Carolina on Saturday --
and Donald Trump has a big lead at 35%.

Let's take a look at what else Trump's voters in South Carolina
support:

--70% think the Confederate flag should still be flying over the
state's capitol

--38% wish the South had won the Civil War

--80% support banning Muslims from entering the United States

--62% support a national database of Muslims in the United States

--33% believe Islam should be illegal in the United States

--31% support banning LGBT people from entering the United States

If Donald Trump wins on Saturday, the message will be clear:
These are the values of the GOP.
