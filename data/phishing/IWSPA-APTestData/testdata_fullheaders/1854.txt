Hello,

let's try it again one step at a time.

First, we need to know the operating system version, to do that:
 - double click on the right instance
 - double click on "Commands"
 - click on "New command"
 - write "/usr/bin/sw_vers" (without quotes) and click on "Save"

then domain.com for a sync or two, come back to right instance, double click on "Commands" and you should see the command ouput(as shown in the attached 1.jpg).

Then we need to know the Skype version, here's how to proceed to get it:
- double click on the right instance 
- double click on "File transfer"
- click on "New download"(lower pane)
- write "/Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Info.plist" without quotes, the file path should appear on the lower pane

the domain.com for a sync or two, come back to the right instance, double click on "Evidence" and you should see a new "File" evidence(as shown in 2.jpg). Click on "Download" and attach the file to this ticket.
