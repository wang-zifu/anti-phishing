Just ended the official Academy Screening and Q and A with David Ayer, Logan Lerman and Michael Pena.
The theater was 3/4 full with approx 700+ people in attendance.  About 1/3 stayed for the Q and A.

Film received warm applause throughout the credits....of particular note were applause for Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Steven Price, Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn and Paul Ottosson. (The Academy rep reminded us after the screening that is isn't often that crafts credits get applause)

Moderated Q & A with Geoff Boucher was a good discussion that touched on the research, how this film was different than other WWII films, what it was like in the tank, how the actors felt while shooting the film, David's unique directing style and working with Brad Pitt.

It was a very solid screening and discussion.

Tonight is also the DGA screening for David Ayer...will send a note when it concludes.

Thanks.

Santa Barbara Screening and Q & A of Fury just ended and went extremely well.  It got strong applause and a standing ovation when David Ayer walked in.

FIlm played to a packed house and more than 2/3 stayed for the 30 min Q &A with David Ayer and Logan Lerman.

Conversation touched on the attention to detail paid to the uniforms, tanks, weapons, etc...how Brad Pitt came to be part of the project, working with Brad Pitt, Logan Lermans preparation for the film, the boot camp the actors went thru, David Ayers's history and his family's history as veterans, some history of WWII.

David and Logan were incredibly articulate and did a terrific job. They stayed after to take photos and answer questions with audience members.  

This was a great kick-off to the events we have in NY next week.

Let Lisa Taback or I know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Thank you.
