Think Like A Man Tracking - Final Memo

Think Like A Man Too makes the right moves, and today has 29% unaided (+3), 94% total awareness (+3), 66% definite interest, 28% first choice (+5), and 46% first choice among opening and released (+12). We will hope for one more surge in unaided and first choice tomorrow, but we are already in place for a fantastic weekend. 




Against our comps, this latest push with unaided gets us even with them overall. While first choice is affected by the summer marketplace, and yet another big film debuting on tracking today, first choice among opening and released made the leap forward we needed it to today.

Among the general audience, we continue to look best with females 17-34, and they make some nice gains today. They have 18% unaided (+10), 75% total awareness (+10), 47% definite interest, 12% first choice (+1), and 17% first choice among opening and released (+4). 




Dawn of the domain.com of the Apes has a strong debut on both general and African-American tracking. On general tracking they come on with 5% unaided, 83% total aware, 47% definite interest, and 9% first choice. On our African-American oversample they are nearly identical but with more pronounced interest (5/85/61/9).  




Kevin will be on Chelsea Lately and Conan tonight, and tomorrow all the guys will be on the Steve Harvey show, wrapping up the campaign with the man whose book started it all. This has been an extraordinary campaign. It all started with a great movie that audiences overwhelmingly believe is better than the original, and should grant us great word of mouth over the weekend and into the weeks to come. We don’t always have a cast that matches our work ethic, but over the past month we have seen all of them zig-zag across the country promoting this movie, and it will pay dividends. We had a bevy of great promotions with products for men and women that kept up our presence in stores throughout the country. Our digital campaign kept a steady stream of content, kept it varied, social, and always funny. Lastly, on television, radio, and outdoor we were in all the right places, and we had materials that never wavered in their promise of the characters people love, in a bigger, funnier, vegas-themed summer event. 




Congratulations to everyone on their tireless work, let’s have some fun this weekend!
