Why Lame Duck Budget Battle is Really a Struggle Between the 1% and Ordinar
y Americans

     To hear some pundits tell it, the Lame Duck budget battle is about the
 =93unsustainable federal domain.com,=94 or =93entitlement reform,=94 or even 
=93tax rates.=94  These characterizations make it sound like a contest betw
een two competing sets of policies and programs.

      But underlying all of the policy-speak, the Lame Duck budget battle i
s really about one question.  Will the 1% of Americans who had the party th
at caused the domain.com be asked to pay the bill?

       The pain of =93fixing=94 the domain.com should not be distributed widel
y.  It should be distributed fairly =96 to the people who caused the proble
m and reaped the domain.com =96 the wealthiest people in America.

      The Lame Duck battle goes right to the most important question facing
 our political and economic decision-makers at this moment in American hist
ory: will we continue to allow the wealthiest 1% of Americans to siphon off
 all of our economic growth for themselves, or will the benefits of that gr
owth be widely spread to ordinary Americans?   What portion of the goods an
d services produced by our society will go to the wealthiest 1% of American
s =96 and how much goes to everyone else?

     From what some right wing pundits and =93wise men=94 from the business
 community say, you=92d think that America is poorer today than it was fift
y years ago, when Medicare and Medicaid became part of our social contract 
=96 or 70 years ago when we created Social Security.  Some of the =93entitl
ement programs=94 we=92ve had for decades are now =93unsustainable=94 they 
say. 

      We no longer can afford to guarantee seniors a decent retirement?  We
 can=92t afford to guarantee every American the right to decent health care
?  We can=92t afford to provide guaranteed pensions =96 or to provide a liv
ing wage to our workers so they can look forward to providing a better stan
dard of living for their kids? We just can=92t do big things anymore like b
uild the Interstate Highway system, or send someone to the moon, or create 
the domain.com? They claim that =93we=94 =96 meaning most of us but certainly
 not the 1% -- have to get used to the new =93normal=94 of austerity and lo
wered expectations.

      To put it bluntly, that is simply ridiculous.

      To understand what is really going on all you have to know is three c
ritical facts:

      1). First, for the last three decades our per-person gross domestic p
roduct =96 the amount that the average person in America produces in goods 
and services -- has consistently increased.  That increase has been slowed 
by several economic downturns and by the Great Recession, but over time, we
 have more to go around today than we did thirty years ago.

      In fact, real (adjusted for inflation) per capita gross domestic prod
uct (GDP) increased more than 80% over the period between 1975 and 2005.  I
n the last ten years, before the Great Recession, it increased at an averag
e rate of 1.8% per year.  That means that if the benefits of economic growt
h were equally spread throughout our society, everyone should have been alm
ost 20% better off (with compounding) in 2015 than they were in 1998.

     2). But ordinary people weren=92t better off.  In fact, median family 
income actually dropped in the years before the recession.  It fell from $5
2,301 (in 2015 dollars) in 2015 to $50,112 in 2008. And, of course it conti
nued to drop as the recession set in. In fact, as a group, ordinary America
ns haven=92t had a raise in about 30 years.

     How is that possible?

     Was it =96 as the Right likes to argue =96 because of the growth of th
e Federal Government?  Nope. In fact, the percentage of GDP going to federa
l spending actually dropped during the last four years of the Clinton Admin
istration. When Bush took office it began to increase again as the Republic
ans increased spending on wars.  Over the last 28 years, federal spending h
as averaged about 20.9% of the GDP and varied within a range of only about 
5%, with the high being in 1983 (in the middle of the Reagan years) and the
 low in 2015 before Bush took office.  It has never even come close to the 
43.6% of GDP that it consumed during World War II in 1943 and 1944, or the 
41.9% it consumed in 1945.   The percent of GDP that goes to Federal spendi
ng went up in 2015 and 2015 =96 but that was mainly because the economy shr
unk on the one hand, and a major, temporary stimulus bill was need on the o
ther to prevent another Great Depression.

    Was it because taxes have skyrocketed?  No again.  In fact, Bureau of E
conomic Analysis data indicates that Americans now pay 23.6% of income for 
state, local and federal taxes compared to 27% from the 1970=92s through th
e 1990=92s.  In fact, the overall tax burden is the lower today than it has
 been since 1958.

     Was it that labor became less productive?  No.  In fact, there has bee
n a major gap between the increase in the productivity of our workforce and
 the increase in their wages.  Even when wages were improving at the end of
 the Clinton years, productivity went up 2.5% per year and median hourly wa
ges went up only 1.5%.

      From 2015 to 2004, worker productivity exploded by an annual rate of 
3.8% but hourly wages went up only 1% and median family income actually dro
pped .9%.

     The bottom line is that people who work for a living (most of us) are 
getting a smaller and smaller slice of the nation=92s economic pie.

     In fact, wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of the nation
=92s gross domestic product since the government started keeping records in
 1947.  And corporate profits have climbed to their highest levels since th
e 1960=92s.

      Which brings us to fact number three.

      3). Virtually all of the increase in our gross domestic product over 
the ten years before the Great Recession went to the wealthiest 2% of the p
opulation.

     These changes in income distribution are not the result of =93natural 
laws.=94  They were the result of systems set up by human beings that diffe
rentially domain.com different groups in the society.

      And that is what the Lame Duck budget battle is all about.  The wealt
hiest people in America want to continue to siphon off all of the growth in
 productivity and economic production =96 it=92s that simple.

      When George Bush took office from Bill Clinton we had a massive budge
t surplus.  The reason was that Clinton had passed a tax bill that mainly i
ncreased the tax rates paid by the wealthiest Americans.  Republicans made 
dire predictions that these new taxes on the wealthy would cause a recessio
n.  Instead, the economy expanded like gangbusters.  Under Clinton the econ
omy created 22 million new jobs.  The tech boom contributed mightily to inc
reased productivity of the American work force.   And, notwithstanding the 
increase in taxes, the rich weren=92t hurting.  Many fortunes were made dur
ing the 1990=92s.

     But the wealthiest Americans and their representatives in the Republic
an Party wanted more.  After the Supreme Court handed George Bush and the R
epublicans the election victory in 2000, they insisted that tax rates for t
he wealthy be slashed. And when the Republicans launched two wars they refu
sed to increases taxes on the rich =96 or anyone else =96 to pay the bill.

      Now they insist that cost of fixing the domain.com they created, should 
fall upon the poor and the middle class and they should be asked to pay not
hing.  Instead, they want Social Security recipients who make $15,000 per y
ear to have their Medicare benefits cut.  Instead, they want to cut our spe
nding on education and new roads and domain.com systems.  Instead they want to
 cut food stamps and unemployment benefits that help prevent ordinary domain.com
e from falling into poverty when they are laid off by a company like Sensat
a, that is making money manufacturing its products in the U.S. but wants to
 make even more by shipping its jobs to China.

      The increasing costs of the country=92s health care programs are not 
driven by greedy seniors, or by =93unsustainable entitlement programs.=94  
They are driven by rising health care costs =96 that result in large measur
e from the fact that our insurance company-driven health care system led us
 to pay twice as much per capita for health care than any other society on 
earth =96 even though we are 37th in health care outcomes.
      You bet we have to control health care costs, but we don=92t do that 
by transferring those costs to ordinary people whose share of the economic 
pie has been stagnating for years.  We need to do that by creating a more r
ational system for financing and delivering health care =96 a project that 
has finally begun with the passage of ObamaCare.

      Changes to Medicare or Medicaid that actually control health care cos
ts are a great idea.  We might start by allowing Medicare to negotiate with
 drug companies to get lower rates on prescriptions =96 which was explicitl
y prohibited under the law that created Republican-crafted Medicare Part D 
drug domain.com.

      But Democrats should not agree to any change in Medicare or Medicaid 
that cuts benefits for ordinary Americans.  Ordinary Americans didn=92t ben
domain.com from the party that caused the domain.com, and they shouldn=92t be asked 
to pay the bill.

     Maybe the most outrageous proposal coming out of the =93big thinkers
=94 who flack for Wall Street and the CEO class, is the proposal to raise t
he Social Security retirement age.

       Remember that Social Security has absolutely nothing to do with the 
domain.com.  In fact the Social Security Trust Fund has been in surplus since 
it was reformed in 1980.  Regardless, the one percent crowd insists that So
cial Security is  =93unsustainable=94 in its current form and the way to fi
x it is to require that everyone retire later.

     That may make sense to editorial writers or business executives who lo
ve their jobs, make big salaries and have no intention of retiring at 65.  
It makes no sense at all to people who do manual labor or clean hotel rooms
 and are paid a minimum wage.

      The people making these proposals will never be affected by increasin
g the retirement age.  The people who are being asked to sacrifice are gene
rally the people who work the hardest for the lowest pay and have not benef
ited at all from the economy growth that their labor helped to fuel over th
e last 30 years.

      This proposal is particularly outrageous when you realize that the pa
yroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare don=92t apply to inco
me over $110,000 per year.  If everyone paid the same percentage of their i
ncome in payroll taxes as a the average American that earns $50,000 per yea
r, the Social Security Trust Fund would be solvent for the next 75 years.

       When wealthy executives who make millions say that America can=92t 
=93afford=94 the current Social Security and Medicare programs, what they r
eally mean is that they don=92t want to pay their fair share to support the
se critical programs.   What they are really saying is that they have a rig
ht to take all of the increased economic growth that our society generates 
over the next three decades the same way they have for the last 30 years.

      It is up to Democrats =96 to all everyday middle class Americans -- t
o just say no to the greed and arrogance that underlies their proposals tha
t everyday Americans should have to sacrifice more, so that the 1% doesn=92
t have to pay its fair share.

     It=92s time we refuse to give any credibility whatsoever to their absu
rd assertions that increasing taxes on the rich will slow the economy by pu
nishing =93job creators.=94  In fact, economic history =96 and most recentl
y the Clinton years =96 demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt -- that e
conomies grow from the middle out, not the top down.  Economic history demo
nstrates that the best way to grow an economy is to make sure that ordinary
 American consumers have growing incomes that will allow them to buy the go
ods and services that their increased productivity can produce.   Middle cl
ass consumers with money in their pockets are the true =93job creators.=94

     Republican policies that allow the wealthy to continue siphoning off a
ll of our growth in national income are the true enemy of long-term economi
c growth.  They are a formula for economic stagnation because they are a re
cipe for the destruction of America=92s middle class.

      It=92s up to us to demand that Wall Street gamblers who don=92t make 
anything of value should no longer be allowed to pay a smaller share of the
ir income in taxes than teachers or firefighters or the millions of America
ns who go to work every day and actually create the goods and services that
 people need to live more fulfilling lives.

      And it=92s up to the media to understand that in the final analysis, 
the Lame Duck budget battle is not about policies and programs at all =96 i
t=92s about right and wrong.
