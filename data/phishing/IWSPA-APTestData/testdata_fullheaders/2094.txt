Financial Services Chair Barney Frank, Subcommittee Chairs, Advocates
and Business Leaders Make the Case for Consumer Financial Watchdog 

Washington, DC - On Wednesday, July 22 at 11:30 am, House Financial
Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, business leaders and other key
Members of Congress will join Americans for Financial Reform to make the
economic case for the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. This agency
would serve as a watchdog for our wallets, protecting hard-working
Americans from the kinds of predatory practices that helped topple our
economy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other financial institutions
are looking to steamroll consumers by opposing this crucial reform.
Recently, the financial services industry
<<<link>>

<<<link>>>  launched
multi-million dollar public relations and lobbying campaign to weaken
and defeat the proposed consumer watchdog.

Americans for Financial Reform <<<link>>>
is a national coalition of nearly 200 state and local organizations
<<<link>>>  ranging from
financial experts to community working to reform the financial system
and rebuild our economy.

Protection Agency
