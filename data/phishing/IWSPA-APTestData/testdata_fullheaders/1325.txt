	This ridiculously easy trick makes your PowerPoint a winner.




												We all groan at the thought of another PowerPoint® presentation.  



												 Why? Because they all look the same. 
												 They all use the same boring bullets and too often they
												are delivered by simply reading the bullets off the slide.
												 Whether you use PowerPoint® to persuade, to sell, to
												train, or to report, you only succeed if you can stand
												out and engage your audience. Boring doesn't cut it.
												What's the trick to make your PowerPoint® a winner? 
												Easy! Lose the bullets. Use visual slides instead. 



														"What a relief! I thought it was someone wanting me to go to the PowerPoint presentation."

									Bullets vs. Visual
									Nothing communicates as immediately and powerfully as a
									visual. In fact, studies show that communicating with
									visuals is up to six times more effective than with
									words alone. Only visuals can show how things relate
									to each other, and only visuals are universally
									understood around the world. 
									Despite their power, visuals are very rarely used in
									presentations. Why? Because it's so easy to create bullets
									in PowerPoint and so hard to create visuals! 
									Creating Visual Presentations
									The answer is to use a program designed to create visual
									presentations, in conjunction with PowerPoint®. With
									SmartDraw, you can quickly and easily create a powerful
									visual presentation and then save it as a PowerPoint®
									document in a single click!
