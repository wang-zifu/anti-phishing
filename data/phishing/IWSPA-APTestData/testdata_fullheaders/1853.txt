Hi John,

Sorry to bother you but one more quick question.  Ms. Fine was acting head 
of admin and then didn't get the job.  Was there any reason related to her 
performance that you know of that made Neera choose differently.

Thanks.  I'm planning on making her an offer and see if I can act more quic
kly than my new York rivals.
