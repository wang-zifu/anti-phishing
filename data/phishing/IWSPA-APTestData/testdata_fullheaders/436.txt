Unclear exactly what 60 is doing, but Craig has had an initial meeting with
 them to see if we can finesse this from starting off in such a ridiculous 
place as to have its premise be that book.  Let's also remember that the la
st time 60 went hard on a book that tried to scandalize something related t
o us it was the Benghazi telling by the former British commando, and the ou
tcome was Lara Logan's suspension and the publisher having to pull the book
 off the shelves.

So the hope is that before we start having to push back on the story we hav
e at least some hope of combatting the premise as ridiculous.

And of course, having the book would help that.

I'll keep everyone posted.
