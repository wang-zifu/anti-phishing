A hard request....
My wife never asks to do anything or go to anything
If there was any way for me to take her to the french state dinner tuesday.
..it would be very special for her
Gaspard had invited us to lots of things which we never went to but said la
st year that he would sort a state dinner
I haven't wanted to ask
