ProgressNow Colorado Education

Dear Friend,

Sen. Jessie Ulibarri
I wanted to share a story with you all that I shared first on Facebook
this weekend. My friends at ProgressNow Colorado saw it and asked if I
would be okay to share this story in an email so more people could
read it.=A0

<<link>>

My heart and head ache this evening. Israel turned 15 last week and
he's having a belated birthday party tonight. He asked me if he and
his friends could go outside this evening and play "Cops and Robbers"
with his Nerf guns.=A0

My stomach lurched and cold fingers of fear grasped at my throat when
I imagined my dark son, dressed in a sweatshirt, running through the
streets of our neighborhood. With a dry mouth and wet eyes, I angrily
told him that he could not go outside and play a simple childhood
game.=A0

I hope he knows that I am not angry with him, but I'm infuriated with
the world we're raising him in. I'm angry at myself for limiting my
son and denying him his youth because I'm petrified of what may happen
to him for LWB (living while brown). I'm angry that black and brown
boys are always seen as a threat, and never the joyful kids I know
them to be.=A0

The verdict in the Trayvon Martin case has caused so much pain for so
many, and our family grieves tonight. We mourn not just Trayvon and
his family, but for the loss of innocence and freedom every brown and
black kid endures with this verdict.

I know we're all looking for something to give us hope after the
events of this past weekend. I find hope in my children's eyes.
I find hope in working for change every day as a Senator in the
Colorado state legislature. I find hope in the kind words friends and
strangers have offered up at this difficult time.

That's why I'm asking if you'd be willing to share
your story. How did you talk to your children about Trayvon Martin?
What words have moved or comforted you in the past few days? I think
right now, having these conversations about what we can do to make
things better is one of the most important things we can do. Would you
be willing to share your story with me?=A0

I am proud to join with ProgressNow Colorado to share my story, and I
hope you will share yours, too. =A0As a parent, I know the
importance of sharing these stories to help keep this important
conversation going.=A0

Thank you so much for your time.

Jessie Ulibarri
Colorado State Senator
