Nov 30 SAG Q&A Today

Hello - today,  we once again  screened for a SAG-heavy audience along with AMPAS, press and guild members in attendance.

The reception was very warm with heavy applause and a few stood up to welcome the cast and David for the Q&A. 

Pete Hammond moderated like a pro and discussed the writing, the crafts, the challenges of the acting process, working with David, and included each cast member in the conversation.  

David did a wonderful job answering questions by including the cast members in his responses. He spent time talking about the storytelling and working with the actors to keep the story alive. Knowing that the audience was primarily SAG, the conversation leaned heavily towards acting which was great.  David, Bradley, Amy, Elisabeth and Shea all had an opportunity to answer questions and participate.

Overall, a great Q&A.
