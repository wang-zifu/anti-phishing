Dan Quayle on Today:

Do you think Donald Trump has the experience, the knowledge and the temperament to be president?

-          "We're going to find out."

-          "He's got good political instincts, he has a good business background, he's a winner and he's unusual. He's obviously very different. He's not going to play by the rules."

Anything about his temperament that gives you pause?

-          "He really needs to get more involved in the policy. He made a speech on foreign policy. He's got to make another speech on foreign policy, he's got to make speeches on the economy. He's got to show that he's presidential."

Is he as qualified as Hillary Clinton?

-          "On paper you would say she's more qualified. But you know what? He's more qualified in the sense that the American people, I think, want an outsider. They want an outsider this time. She's not an outsider and he is."

Should he release Tax Returns?

-          "He's not going to do that."

-          "He's a different candidate, it's going to be a different campaign."

Who should his VP be?

-          Rob Portman
