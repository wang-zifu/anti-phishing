Lindsey and Kristele, Pablo Manriquez came in today to domain.com his resignation. He was offered a much higher salary at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and will be departing soon. He initially said two weeks but I asked him for three. Kristele, do we have an old booker job description we can update to start the candidate search?

Let me know if you have any questions.
