Santa Barbara Film Society Q&A

Good afternoon - David just completed the Q&A with the Santa Barbara Film Society.

The film played in a packed house and about 95% stayed for the Q&A. There was a standing ovation at the end of the screening, which per Roger Durling is a rare occurrence. 

Roger Durling moderated the Q/A. It lasted about half an hour. They touched upon the key themes of the movie and how David feels that American Hustle is the third film in a trilogy of his work. 

Immediately after the Q/A, David attended a reception hosted by SB Cinema Society Member Maggie Gallant. There were about 50 guests most of who are Academy members. David stayed an hour and David spoke to most in attendance. He was very warmly received. 

Overall, an incredibly successful afternoon. 

More to come after SAG tonight. 

Best,

Kira.
