Hey Bill, we were in Alaska this weekend and she's in district today. She won't get a chance to respond just yet. That said, back in January when we added the extra four debates the agreement was that they had to be a DNC-sanctioned debates, and no weekends. So if you feel you have to move ahead with any letter without us it would just have to be clear that it's talking about a DNC-sanctioned debate and on a weeknight.

Beyond that we may not be able to chime in officially on this any time soon since we're having to work with the campaigns behind the scenes, we don't want to pressure them publicly.

Folks,

Any word from the Chair? I'd been hoping to send the invite letters to candidates today, although I suppose I could domain.com until tomorrow.

Lemme know.

Thank you!
