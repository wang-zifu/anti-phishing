John --

In case you haven't heard from her directly, Melody is able to back you up 
at the PICO event on Tuesday. Let me know if you need anything from CAP in 
terms of prep for the event. Attached and below are the event details.

PICO EVENT

Where: Rayburn B-317

When: Tues, Nov. 18th at 4pm.

There will be no press at the event.

From Nov. 17th-19th, PICO is organizing meetings with Congressional represe
ntatives and staff, as well as holding a large public event at the U.S. Tre
asury on the mortgage crisis.

Format

John is invited to speak in front of 200 PICO clergy and faith leaders.

Rev. Dr. George Cummings, pastor of Imani Community Church of Oakland, will
 introduce John. They will be sitting down at a desk. They have asked John 
to speak for 15-20 minutes and then take a few questions (from chosen repre
sentatives) for 15-20 minutes.

They are hoping that John can provide them with a strategic overview of tra
nsition priorities to help shape their 2009-10 organizing campaign strategy
 and to equip faith leaders to lead at the grassroots level on domestic pol
icy change.

The questions Gordon Whitman (Director of Policy and Communications) sugges
ted for John=92s remarks are:

=95        How will the new administration proceed in the first 100 days?
=95        What will be the priorities/key issue areas for the new administ
ration?
=95        How can faith-based groups coordinate their efforts to match tho
se of the new administration and push forward their own priority areas?

Sally Steenland has been talking to member of PICO about the work we are do
ing at CAP and there is certainly overlap in goals, concerns and priories, 
but we have not as of yet embarked in a project together. The PICO membersh
ip is particularly interested in our Half in Ten campaign efforts.

PICO=92s transition priorities are:
Health Care
1.      comprehensive health reform
2.      increase in the federal share of the Medicaid program (FMAP)
3.      Quick passage of SCHIP
Housing
1.      Restructure and rebuild HUD to help communities create stable and a
ffordable housing markets, including resources for effective models of comm

2.      Reduce obstacles to naturalization.
3.      Include youth employment and re-entry initiatives in economic recov

4.      Include a Gulf Coast revitalization initiative addressing affordabl
e housing, green jobs and infrastructure investment in stimulus legislation
.
5.      Promote teacher quality and new innovative public schools, through 
stronger enforcement of comparability and teacher quality equity provisions
 in NCLB.
6.      Poverty-reduction agenda, including assisting low-income communitie
s adapt to economic-energy change by fully-fund weatherization with jobs pr
ogram as part of economic recovery legislation.
