CounselLink: Corporate Legal  M&A Spending Spiked in 2015 
New Enterprise Legal Management Trends Analysis Shows Spending Flowed to “Second Largest” Law Firms for High-Value M&A Legal Work
 RALEIGH, NC – August 5, 2015 – The CounselLink® business, a leading provider of Enterprise Legal Management (ELM) software, announced today the results of its latest ELM Trends Report: Growth in M&A Billings Benefits ‘Second Largest’ Law Firms. The report found law firm billings for merger and acquisition (M&A) related work spiked in 2015 by 77 percent. As its title suggests, the report discovered much of that work went to law firms in the “Second Largest” category employing 501-750 attorneys. 
Within the 2015 data set, the Second Largest firms accounted for 37% of all outside counsel spending on M&A matters, a category of work traditionally directed to the largest law firms – those employing more than 750 lawyers. The changeover occurred in 2012, the gap widened substantially in 2013, and the disparity is even more for high-value M&A legal projects where outside counsel billings exceed $1 million. Last year, the Second Largest earned 52% of all outside counsel spending in this category.
 “General counsel are assigning more M&A matters – especially those with total fees in excess of $1 million – to the “Second Largest” group of firms with 501-750 lawyers,” said Kris Satkunas, CounselLink director of Strategic Consulting and principal author of the report. “With general counsel becoming increasingly savvy in managing outside counsel fees, it is not surprising that many are turning to slightly smaller, but credible firms with lower hourly rates to handle even their most mission critical transactions.”
 The complete Trends Report also provides industry benchmark data and market insights about partner rates, matter costs, law firm panel consolidations, alternative fee usage and other metrics. A complimentary copy of the full report and an accompanying infographic are available at domain.com/2013TrendsReport.
