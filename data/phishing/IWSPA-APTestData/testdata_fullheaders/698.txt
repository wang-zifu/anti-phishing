Subject: Trump Touting Endorsements From "Tough Ones" Tyson, Knight

At IN rally Trump is touting his endorsements from Bobby Knight and Mike Tyson. Saying he likes endorsements from the "tough ones." Also the ones with an offensive history when it comes to rape. And the Tyson assault happened in Indiana....

Bobby Knight is the guy who once said the following of handling stress: "I think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.''
