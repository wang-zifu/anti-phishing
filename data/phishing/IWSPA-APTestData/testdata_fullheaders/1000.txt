Rough Transcript:

*JAKE TAPPER: *vermont senator bernie sanders, who joins us. thanks so much
for being with us, senator. really appreciate it. i have to start by asking
you abt this new poll which shows you winning over
clinton supporters. you're at 30%. she's at 37%. you said earlier this week
at the same old, same old cannot win as we heard in the open. is hillary
clinton the same old, same old?

*BERNIE SANDERS:* well, this is what i can tell you, jake. not only in
iowa, not only in new hampshire, but all over this country we're
generating enormous enthusiasm. people do not understand why the middle
class of this country is collapsing at the same time as almost all of the
new income and wealth is going to the top 1%. people do not like the idea
that as a result of citizens united our campaign finance system has become
corrupt. and politicians are dependent upon super pacs and billionaires for
money. people want us to deal with climate change, make
college affordable. those are the issues i have been talking about. those
are the issues that are generating enormous enthusiasm from one end of this
country to the other.

*JAKE TAPPER: *you also talk about taking on the billionaire class. and
you've said to hillary clinton you're not sure whether or not she will take
on the billionaire class. give us some specifics where you think you would,
and she might not.

*BERNIE SANDERS:* i think that the business model of wall street is
fraud. and i think these guys drove us into the worst economicdown
turn into the modern history of america. i think they're at it again. i
believe when you have so few banks with so much power you have to not only
re-establish -- but you've got to break them up. that is not hillary
clinton's position. i believe our trade policies with china have been a
disaster. i am helping to lead the effort against the
trans-pacific partnership. that is not hillary clinton's position. i
believe, along with pope francis, and almost all scientists, that climate
change is threatening this domain.com in horrendous ways. and that we have to
be aggressive in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, and
defeat, and defeat the keystone pipeline that is not hillary clton's
position. i believe that as opposed to my republican colleagues who want to
cut social security, i believe we should expand social security by lifting
the cap on taxable income. that's not hillary clinton's position. i believe
that we've got to raise the minimum wage over a period of several years to
$15 an hour. not hillary clinton's position. i voted against the war in
iraq. hillary clinton voted for it.

*JAKE TAPPER: *so that's very ambitious agenda you just outlined there. you
said this week that the biggest mistake president obama made was thinking
he could negotiate with speaker boehner and the republican leader
mitch mcconnell. how can you get this very ambitious agenda through,
which includes, you didn't mention, an estate tax on those who domain.com more
than $3.5 million. a trillion dollars spent on infrastructure. how are you
going to do that without dealing with congress?

*BERNIE SANDERS:* and that infrastructure program, jake, would create
some 13 million jobs. i will tell you how i have a lot of respect for
barack obama. he is a friend of mine. the biggest mistake i believe
he made, and i disagree with him on a number of policy issues, but his
biggest political mistake, 2015 political campaign when he rallied millions
of people to stand up and fight back, basically what he said after he's
elected, well, i will take it from here. i will negotiate with boehner and
mitch mcconnell and republicans. two points, first of all these guys never
had any intention of seriously negotiating. i think the president has
caught on to that. but second of all, the powers that be in washington,
wall street, the huge campaign donors, the koch brothers, are so powerful
that the only way we bring about real change in this country, which
republicans the needs of the middle class and working families, is
when millions of people stand up and say enough is . they are organized,
and that is what i'm talking about when i spoke about a
political revolution. no president, not bernie sanders or anybody else, can
do it unless millions of people say you know what? this country belongs to
all of us, our government must represent all of us, and not just a handful
of billionaires. it can't be done within the beltway itself. we need a mass
movement, and that's what we are trying to create, and are succeeding
in creating right now.

*JAKE TAPPER:* i want to ask you about a story unfolding in the news right
now, a deputy sheriff was gunned down at a gas station in texas. police
have charge an murder saying the officer was african-american man with
his targeted because he was wearing his law enforcement uniform. take a
listen to what the sheriff had to say.

*SHERIFF RON HICKMAN:* this rhetoric has gotten out of control. we've heard
black lives matter. all lives matter. well cops' lives matter, too. so why
don't we just drop the qualifier and just say lives matter and take that.

*JAKE TAPPER: *what do you think of that, senator sanders? is the sheriff
right, has the rhetoric got too high?

*BERNIE SANDERS:* no, this is what i think. obviously it is an outrage
that this police officer was basically assassinated. other police officers
have been killed. i worked with police officers when i was mayor. they have
a very, very difficult job and we need to make sure that we have the best
trained, best paid, police departments in the world, and as president
i would help bring that about. community policing, and so forth. on the
other hand, what we also have to understand, it is not acceptable in this
country, when unarmed black people get dragged out of cars, or get
shot. that is happening too often. so in my view, we need major reforms of
our criminal justice system, which, by the way, jake, means that our police
officers are better paid, are better trained, and we end this absurdity in
america of having more people in jail than any other major country on
earth, includingchina. so, criminal justice reform, criminal justice reform
is a big issue for me and making sure that we have the best
police departments throughout this country is something we have got to make
happen.

*JAKE TAPPER:* another horrific news story took place in roanoke,
virginia, wednesday morning with the shooting of those two individuals with
the local news station.

*BERNIE SANDERS:* terrible.

*JAKE TAPPER:* your democratic rivals have been arguing that when it
comes to guns, you are out of step with liberal and progressive primary
voters on the issue of gun control. a surrogate for hillary
clinton, connecticut governor dan malloy went to new hampshire and
said your gun votes had been driven by quote political expediency and this
is a dividing line between you and hillary clinton. your response?

*BERNIE SANDERS: *let me tell you, i have as i understand it a lifetime
voting record from the nra of d-minus. d-minus. i voted very strongly
for instant background checks. i want to see them made stronger. probably
the most important thing that we can do. number two, i voted in a state, by
the way, jake, which have almost no gun control, not an easy vote, i voted
against the nra, and i voted to ban certain types of semiautomatic
weapons. i voted to eliminate this gun show loophole which allows people to
purchase guns without a background check. and by the way, in addition
to that, what i believe is we need to do a lot, lot better job in terms of
mental health in this country. people call my office, they call offices all
over this country, and say you know, my brother, my husband, i'm really
worried about what he might do to himself or other people, we do not have
the capability of treating those folks. when people have mental
health issues, when they're a threat to others or themselves, they should
be able to get counseling immediately. that is not the case right now. so i
do not accept the fact that i have been weak on this issue. in fact, i've
been strong on this issue. and, in fact, coming f a rural state which has
almost no gun control, i think i can get beyond the noise and all of these
arguments and people shouting at each other and come up with real,
constructive, gun control legislation which most significantly gets guns
out of the hands of people who should not have them.

*JAKE TAPPER:* governor martin o'malley tore in to the democratic
national committee on friday, as you know, accusing the party of rigging
the debate process to favor hillary clinton. do you agree with
governor o'malley?

*BERNIE SANDERS:* i think rigging is a strong word. i think that at a time
when so many of our people have given up on the political process. when 80%
of young people did not vote in the last election, 63% of all americans did
not vote, i think debates are a good thing. i think love debates. so i
would like to see more debate debates. i would like to see
groups representing working people have a debate to talk about why the rich
get richer and everybody else gets poorer. i think
environmentalists deserve a debate so we could talk about how we
move aggressively to transform our energy system away from
fossil fuel. debate. i think young people deserve a in terms of my idea and
other ideas about how we make college education in this country in public
colleges and universities tuition free. how we deal with student debt. how
we deal with tax reform =E2=80=93

*JAKE TAPPER:* senator sanders =E2=80=93

*BERNIE SANDERS:* yeah?

*JAKE TAPPER:* the Organizationas you know, is saying that if you or
governor o'malley participate in any nonsanctioned debate, then you don't
get to participate in the official ones. they are restricting the number of
debates.

*BERNIE SANDERS:* and i think that that is dead wrong and i have let
the leadership of the democrats know that. again, i think this
country benefits all people benefits, democracy benefits when we
have debates. i want to see more of them.

*JAKE TAPPER:* i know you have not been a particular fan of donald trump or
his campaign rhetoric. he has called recently however for raising taxes on
those who run hedge funds. is that an issue where you two agree?

*BERNIE SANDERS: *absolutely. but, even more importantly, look, let's be
clear. we have a situation where major corporations in this country make
billions of dollars in domain.com. they stash their money in the cayman
islands, they don't pay a nickel in taxes. i am funding my plan to
make public colleges and universities tuition-free by a tax on wall street
speculation. when you have hedge fund managers, as warren buffett reminds
us, paying an effective tax rate lower than firemen or police officers,
that's got to change. the rich are getting richer. they're going to have to
start paying their fair share of taxes, as do major corporations.

*JAKE TAPPER: *senator bernie sanders. congratulations on all the success
you're having on the campaign trail. we hope to talk to you soon.

*BERNIE SANDERS:* thank you very much.
