Re: I have a HUGE idea

Thanks guys! I need the band to learn Louis prima's "hey Marie " and I need a domain.com load of dancers and to rehearse it before the show please . 

The bits gonna be that I start telling a talk show story and I stop myself and get upset like I can't finish it and jimmy asks what's wrong and I tell him I forgot how to have fun. I don't know how anymore and he says I know one thing that will work and then the song starts and I do this crazy number with the band and then a hundred dancers come out and it's the most fun crazy thing ever. 

Email isn't the best forum for this idea but trust me. This will be fantastic. 

Thank you so much!

-JH
