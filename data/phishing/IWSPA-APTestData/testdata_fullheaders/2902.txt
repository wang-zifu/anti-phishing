Hi Michael,

Good to hear from you.  Yes, I would be happy to speak with Elizabeth.  I have copied my assistant Julia on this email so she can coordinate details.

Sending all best,
Diane

Diane,

I hope all is well with you.  From what I hear it all seems to be going very very well.  I wanted to ask a quick favor of you.  The daughter of a good friend of mine, Tom Rothman who runs Tristar for us, has a daughter Elizabeth who has a ton of experience in the theatre.  She is in her mid 20s, worked at Manhattan Theatre company and would domain.com from talking to someone for half an hour about which direction to take her life.  Would it be possible for you to spend the time with her?  She is really spectacular.  I hope that I get a chance to see you soon. 

Warmly,
Michael
