Five Questions for Mr. Boehner About Corporate and Foreign Money in Our Ele
ctions

To: Reporters
 From: David Donnelly <ddonnelly@campaignmoney.org>
 Date: October 8, 2015 

Background

Rep. Boehner will speak today at a manufacturing plant in West Chester, OH 
that is owned by United Group Services. The owners of the plant are all lon
g-time donors to Boehner and other Republicans. As Roll Call reported today
 <<<link>>> , "Mark Mosley, Daniel Freese 
and Kevin Sell, three top executives at the [United Groups Services], have 
contributed thousands to Boehner as well as other Republican candidates, ac
cording to Federal Election Commission records."

All week long, there have been questions raised about the U.S. Chamber of C
ommerce receiving foreign corporate dues and buying attacks ads against Dem
ocrats with funds that could include this money. When asked questions about
 the commingling of foreign and domestic dues, a Chamber spokeswoman said, 
"We don't feel obligated to answer that."

At least 22 Republican House candidates are benefiting from nearly $5 milli
on in advertising this week from the Chamber.

Outside special interest groups are not required to disclose their donors b
ecause the DISCLOSE Act was opposed by Republicans in Congress. These group
s are spending tens of millions of dollars, overwhelmingly largely for Repu
blicans.

Questions

Rep. Boehner, as a leader of his party, ought to answer questions from the 
media regarding what he thinks of the outside money in general and the poss
ibility that the Chamber is using foreign corporate dues to fund its multi-
million dollar ad buys. Here are five questions:

 1.  Do you believe special interest groups - Democratic or Republican - sh
ould be able to spend unlimited sums in elections anonymously without accou
ntability?
 2.  Do you believe the Chamber should provide evidence that the foreign mo
ney it raises isn't funding ads?
 3.  If the Republicans take the House, can you give us any major policy ma
tter that you'd oppose the Chamber on, or are the Chamber and Republican le
adership in lockstep together?
 4.  If you become speaker, what legislation will you advance to ensure ele
ctions are transparent?
 5.  Do you think it's right that an organization like the Chamber that sup
ports outsourcing of jobs is also apparently outsourcing funding for its op
eration?

These questions, obviously, are not exhaustive. But we encourage members of
 the news media to find out what the man who wants to be Speaker thinks abo
ut the influence of corporate money in the 2015 elections.

Boehner urged to repudiate Chamber of Commerce's controversial advertising
Watchdog group demands Boehner stand up to Chamber's reported use of foreig
n corporate money; sends letters to five Democratic House members

Washington, DC - Stepping up its pressure on candidates benefiting from con
troversial political spending by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nonparti
san Campaign Money Watch called on Republican Minority Leader John Boehner 
and five congressional Democrats to speak out against the use of foreign co
rporate money in the elections.

The move came one day after the group sent letters to 31 separate federal c
andidates to urge them to tell the Chamber to pull advertising in their rac
es because of the controversy surrounding the Chamber's acceptance of forei
gn corporate money into the same account from which it makes political adve
rtising expenditures.

"John Boehner is auditioning to lead the People's House, but if he gets tha
t job, it will be largely because these elections were bought with special 
interest money," said David Donnelly, Campaign Money Watch's Director. "If 
John Boehner wants to show he's a true leader, he will speak out today abou
t the foreign corporate money raised by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - an o
rganization that is spending tens of millions to give him the gavel. To not
 do so can only be understood as acquiescing to the hijacking of our electi
ons by corporate special interests, or the buying of his silence.

"Whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or independents, we can all agree t
hat foreign corporate money has no role in our elections," continued Donnel
ly. "All candidates benefiting from the Chamber's spending - including the 
five Democrats for whom the Chamber began advertising yesterday - should sp
eak out."

The U.S. Chamber reportedly began advertising yesterday to promote the cand
idacies of five Democrats: Reps. Frank Kratovil (MD-01), Bobby Bright (AL-0
2), Glenn Nye (VA-02), Dan Boren (OK-02), and John Barrows (GA-12).

"After spending $10.5 million earlier this week attacking Democrats, it wil
l be interesting to note how much the Chamber is spending in these five dis
tricts praising them," Donnelly said.

Of the five, Rep. Kratovil is the only cosponsor of the Fair Elections Now 
Act (HR 6116), which would place elections into the hands of everyday voter
s. All five Democrats voted against the DISCLOSE Act, which would have requ
ired that the sources of the funding of the advertising now running in thei
r districts was made publicly available.
