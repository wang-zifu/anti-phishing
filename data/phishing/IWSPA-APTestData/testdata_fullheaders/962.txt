RE: Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2 - France

Hotel T opening day €413,000.  




Cloudy 1 did US$5.4MM lifetime

Hotel T did US$14.7MM lifetime




Given the longer holiday period than we had for Cloudy 1, I’d say we have a good chance at Eric’s target of $9M which if we hit it, would be the one of the biggest increases from Cloudy 1 to Cloudy 2 of any market.
