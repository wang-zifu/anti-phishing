How to Rethink a Better Approach to IT Operations Management

Conceptually, virtualization provides an incredible opportunity to change the way IT is managed. This is accomplished through Virtualization’s ability to use software controls to dynamically change resource allocation and workload configurations for applications operating across a shared physical infrastructure. In effect, virtualization enables the environment to be horizontally scaled (to meet specific workload demand) and vertically scaled (to reallocate resources based on existing workload requirements) in rapid fashion.

This is absolutely vital, because, the traditional approach of collecting data, generating alerts and manually troubleshooting cannot scale to meet the requirements of this new architecture. IT operators struggle to keep pace and the collection mechanism itself creates a significant tax on the overall system. Moreover, this approach is not designed to leverage the inherent fluidity in virtual data centers to control the environment based on workload demands, resource capacity, and configuration and business constraints. Read on to learn how to rethink IT operations management and get the most out of your virtualized data center.
