Bridgeway University invites you to this informative and practical call on building a world-class legal operations function with special guest Jeff Paquin, former Divisional Vice President, Legal Operations & Chief Operations Counsel, Abbott Laboratories.

Reinventing the Law Department: Building a World-class Legal Operations Function

General counsel and their corporate law departments require a variety of operational services, legal services, and operational-legal hybrid services to function, in areas ranging from outside counsel management to intellectual property operations to electronic discovery, all under the banner of “law department operations.”  Leading law departments are now focusing on building a world-class legal operation function in order to manage all these services to the overall goals of departmental efficiency, cost reduction and risk mitigation.

This webcast will outline the key steps towards building a world-class legal operations function, including: needs assessments, strategic plans, team building, project management, implementation, measurement and continuous improvement.
