Dear John,

A quarter-century ago, one of the most influential white papers in modern A
merican politics was published. "The Politics of Evasion," by William A. Ga
lston and Elaine C. Kamarck, was a wake-up call to a Democratic Party that 
had lost three straight presidential elections and seemed completely at sea
.

All these years later, there's another party on a losing streak. And this i
s why we asked Bill and Elaine to domain.com their seminal essay and see how i
t's held up. We present "The New Politics of Evasion," (<<link>>

bxG5l3xUdaxxsO-SNJ5Dd8ZoEtjpIamuoG-m3-Yf29uGag=3D=3D) in which the authors 
size up what they got right, what they got wrong, and how it came to be tha
t the Republicans became the party that can't face up to uncomfortable trut
hs about itself.

The issue next features a very sharp and timely piece on U.S.-Russia relati
ons by Andrew Weiss (<<link>>

 is tempted to say that as long as Putin is around an enduring improvement 
in relations is hopeless, he does see some areas where cooperation is possi
ble.

We also have Richard V. Reeves, Isabel Sawhill, and Kimberly Howard (http:/

"parenting gap," which leaves millions of children behind long before schoo
l has started. It's high time, they write, that progressives get over conce
rns about appearing to lecture poor parents, while also ensuring that they 
get the tools to be better parents. Finally, Henry Farrell (<<link>>

ellectuals who purport to explain how technological advances are changing o
