Thank you Aaron!!!From: "DeLuca, Michael"
It was great seeing you both yesterday. I've gotten Scott and Danny to the point where they're now a little interested in Tom Cruise. Though both remain concerned about his age (me less so) everyone agrees that he's an actor who can really handle language (Lions
 for Lambs, Magnolia, A Few Good Men) and a movie star who feels comfortable owning the stage. He's in London filming right now and Scott wants to get him a script to read and a meeting with Danny before Danny comes here to LA next week. I've
 been warned that he likes to bring in Chris McQuarrie to re-write but Maha Dakhil (who wants him in the movie) has assured me that won't happen.
