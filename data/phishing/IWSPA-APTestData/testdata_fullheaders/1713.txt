John      You can imagine the # of people asking me how to get on the
transition team and thus far this is the only one that I would seriously
ask you to consider.    Lisa Kazor has started her own business
providing financial services to other companies and various Govt
agencies and it has grown to several hundred employees and over $20
million in revenues annually.   MOST importantly she is an amazing
philanthropist and someone you should know anyway.....also, a great and
frequent Democratic backer.   She is NOT a lobbyist.     I would greatly
appreciate your or someone contacting her and placing her in the correct
place at the transition.....please let me know if you have any
questions......also let me know what I can do to help ANYTIME!!     Best
....  pax    Terry
