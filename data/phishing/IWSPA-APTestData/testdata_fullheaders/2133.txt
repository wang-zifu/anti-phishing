2014 Master Class - Hallmarks of a High-Performance Board

Dear Amy,

As a public company director, your boardroom role is quickly becoming more and more complex. Outside pressures in the form of emerging technology, globalization, data security, increased transparency, and regulation create a more dynamic risk matrix that demands more from the board.

As such, we've revamped the 2015 NACD Master Class series to foster robust dialogue around the five key areas that are the hallmarks of a high-performance board amidst the ever-changing and more demanding environment:

Board composition

Leadership and process

Information

Performance metrics

Dynamics and culture 

During the next Master Class, August 18-19 in Laguna Beach, CA, seasoned directors will lead a candid, peer-to-peer exploration and discussion of how these five factors work in concert to create an effective board. 

Then, we'll use this framework as a lens for both improving committee performance and exploring the board's role in addressing critical, emerging issues--from crisis and cyber risk to strategic decisions around mergers and acquisitions. We hope you can join us. 

Master Class is an NACD Member exclusive event. If you are interested in joining and attending, please contact me via email, or call me directly at 202-803-6764.
