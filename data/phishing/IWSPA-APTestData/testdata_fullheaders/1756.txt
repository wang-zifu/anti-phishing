						Dear Amy,



						Greg had gone almost a week with no food, no sleep, no shelter … nothing. Life on Skid Row had become about one thing only; survival. He came to the Los Angeles Mission to get what he needed to survive, but he stayed until he had what he needed to thrive.



						Today Greg is healthy, he’s employed, and he’s a brand new man. As you watch Greg’s story you can see the vital part you play in changing and saving lives like his. You can see for yourself what happens when your gift turns into a meal and that meal turns into hope.



						There’s another Greg that needs a meal today. Truth is there are literally thousands. At just $2.03 each, can you feed and care for one of them? Can you feed and care for more?



						Thank you for giving a gift today that will literally change a life.



						Herb Smith
						President & CEO 



						P.S. – Please join us on Facebook and Twitter for our latest updates at the Los Angeles Mission. And check out Ziggedy, a great way to provide meals and care at no cost to you.
