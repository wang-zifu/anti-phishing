Cornyn Can't Say What Republicans Will 'Give In Return' For Concessions Fro
m Democrats<<<link>>
/>

<<link>>

This morning, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) refused to say what Republicans would
 be willing to "to give in return" if Democrats accepted GOP proposals afte
r the bipartisan health care domain.com. Cornyn insisted that the Democrats mus
t scrap the current legislation and start from scratch if they hope to win 
bipartisan support.

CNN anchor Kiran Chetry<<<link>>
an.html> twice tried to ask Cornyn if there is "anything Republicans would 
be willing to give on in return," but Cornyn responded by criticizing the e
xisting legislation:

CORNYN: Really, I think it's not possible to take this bill or this proposa
l, this 11 page summary and to work with it around the edges. We're going t
o have to put it on the shelf. That's what the American people want us to d
o and start over and we would be glad to do that.

Watch it:

Republicans have long argued, somewhat disingenuously<<<link>>
domain.com/2009/10/23/rockefeller-malpractice/>, that placing capping non
-economic damages would reduce health care spending and Obama has signaled 
thathe may be willing to accept some of their proposals<<<link>>
domain.com/2010/02/09/obama-malpractice-domain.com/>. It's unlikely that Ob
ama will adopt caps, but he could could embrace a 'Sorry-Works' proposal<ht
tp://domain.com/cgi/content/full/354/21/2205>. While in the Senate, O
bama also co-sponsored "legislation aimed at reducing both medical errors a
nd lawsuits<<<link>>> through a
 program known as Sorry Works, rooted in the idea that injured patients val
ue an apology as much as money." That legislation would have given physicia
ns who disclosed their errors "certain protections from liability within th
e context of the program, in order to promote a safe environment for disclo
sure."

I've proposed four other areas where Democrats and Republicans can reach bi
partisan agreement here<<<link>>
domain.com-ideas/>. But if Cornyn's answer is any indication, Republican's are mo
re interested in obstructing reform than passing it.
