Hey Rachel-

There is not currently anyone advising press at the ASDC meeting. Checking in with the DNCC I think the wires were crossed as to whether DNCC was doing it given the structure of the meeting agenda.

If it's easier - I can reach out to the DNCC press team and ask if they can have someone here.

The chair is speaking at 3 on Friday at our business meeting that starts at 2:30 however there's a DNCC briefing (closed press) at 12 that he may also want to attend. If not  2 pm would be fine.

At present I don't expect that press will attend but that could change

Thanks,
Jonae
