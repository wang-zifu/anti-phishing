Likely this week (I am confirming timing with Debbie Stabenow today), Rober
ts will introduce a bill that postpones the scheduled 7/1/16 implementation
 of Vermont's mandatory state GMO labeling law (as well as any other state 
initiatives) for a number of years (we don't yet know how long he is propos
ing) to give the largest grocery manufacturers time to try to implement the
ir so-called smart label digital scanning solution.  This is an overt attem
pt to avoid them from having to put a simple disclosure on their food packa
ging, as is the common practice in 64 other countries including all of the 
EU.  We haven't seen the final language yet, but the idea is that, after th
e requisite number of years has passed, some third party would be engaged b
y FDA or USDA to do a national survey and if a certain % of consumers ackno
wledged that the digital scanning technology was working, then VT and other
 states' laws would be permanently pre-empted.  Presumably if that % thresh
old was not reached, the state laws could go ahead.

As you can tell, this is so weak and vague that it instead is really is a c
omplete and crushing win by industry over consumers' rights to know.  It al
so is a brazen assertion of federal authority over not only VT's already-pa
ssed law, but over the 3-6 other states that will likely pass exactly simil
ar GMO labeling measures this year (RI, MA, NY, NJ) not to mention the 20+ 
other states that are debating equivalent measures.   It is another example
 of the Republicans' hypocritical practice of supporting states' rights whe
n it serves them and crushing them when it does not.

We are working to either amend or stop it, but they are pouring tens of mil
lions into lobbying and have already seduced Tom Vilsack into seeing this a
s some kind of compromise. One of their inaccurate and disingenuous represe
ntations is that this will help avoid a "patchwork quilt" of different stat
e bills, but we have ensured that all the state measures are identical.

We explicitly counter-proposed to Tom and them that a measure that would be
 more fair and balanced for consumers and average citizens would be (a) a 2
-year delay at the end of which (b)  food companies could choose between im
plementing a federal on-packaging disclosure OR complying with any state-ma
ndated disclosures UNLESS the testing threshold of a high enough % had been
 met (we are proposing 90% of those who will be surveyed) of Americans easi
ly being able to know whether GMO's are in their foods or not.  In this way
, it ensures consumers that one way or the other there WILL be a working so
lution in place in 2 years rather than leaving that open-ended.  Our amendm
ent properly puts the burden on Industry to either succeed in their efforts
 or accept the consequences if they don't.

Politically, we can expect Bernie to make a passionate demand that the Robe
rts bill be completely stopped from pre-empting Vermont's and other states'
 laws, that this is an egregious over-reach by Republicans at the expense o
f citizens' rights and yet another example of big business's firm grip on o
ur government (gosh, I bet he might even mention Wall Street).   My guess i
s that he will jump on this soapbox just as soon as the bill is introduced 
but he also may not domain.com.

HRC could seize the day and beat out Bernie by inserting into a speech or i
nterview asap an assertion of her strong support for all consumers, mothers
 and grandmothers to be able to know what is in our foods, that she is awar
e of a pending measure that would offer an industry solution in response to
 the 90% of surveyed americans (2 Mellman polls) who say they want to know 
if their foods contain GMO's and she would be strongly opposed to any bill 
that would not provide an domain.com timetable for people having their rights
 protected and that puts control of the disclosure timeline exclusively in 
Industry's hands...that we are living in a new era in which more and more g
enetically modified foods are being introduced and regardless of how you fe
el about that, people want and deserve the right to be able to know; that w
hen other new technologies like orange juice from concentrate and wild vs f
armed have come along, the government has had a tradition and a responsibil
ity to make sure that consumers can know and choose for whatever reason the
y want, and that this is the way markets work.

One other thing...the Industry has spiced up their argument for the digital
 smart label by saying that they don't want to simply solve the problem of 
GMO transparency, that they want to anticipate other issues that will come 
up (such as humane treatment of animals, palm oil, etc).  This is a straw m
an...no other issue like that has had one state already require labeling an
d several more about to require it, not to mention 20+ other states debatin
g it, and with the recent approval of genetically engineered salmon, apples
 and other products, it is truly disingenuous to try to lump this in with a
 bunch of other vague concerns. 

The bottom line, John, is that Bernie will try to own this issue because it
 really will play with millennials but the timing of this bill affords HRC 
the opportunity to take that from him if she acts swiftly.   

Confidentially, for your eyes only please, this is a video that we will be 
releasing this week which captured HRC speaking in Iowa a few weeks ago: PL

In a moment, I will share a separate email anecdote evidencing Bernie's lac
k of political sophistication and consensus-building skills that could also
 be helpful to you, at least with donors but I want to get this off to you 
now.
