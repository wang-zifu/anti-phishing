Subject: HRC / Dec 15th mtg with PE

the NSC/For. Policy mtg slated for Dec 15th, 2-6pm CST conflicts with HRC's
 schedule - it's the night of her debt relief event in nyc
she has to be wheels up Chicago by 2:30pm CST, in order to be wheels down N
YC 5pm EST

she has a similar problem on the 16th, her staff holiday party 6pm EST.

any flexibility in moving the 15th time up earlier, or do we have her parti
cipate from PTT/SCIF ?
