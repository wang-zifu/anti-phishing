Dear Amy,

All-employee communication events require a well-developed communication process for reaching and engaging every employee. When face-to-face meetings are not possible, high engagement mediums, such as live video webcasting, are the most effective way to communicate business-critical information.

Based on a survey of 675 enterprise communicators from various industries around the world, this report will provide insights, trends and benefits of the ideal all-employee communication channel.

This report will share with you insights and best practices on:

Business Critical Communication

All-employee Communication Process

Enterprise Communication Tools

Extending Engagement

Who should read this report? 

Executive communicators

Internal communicators

Corporate Communication executives

HR executives

We believe the survey findings provide critical data on current trends and challenges for all-employee communication events, as well as employees’ priorities when receiving communication from their leadership. A comprehensive communication process, coupled with high engagement communication tools, such as video webcasts, are key elements of a strategic plan for business-critical, all-employee communication.

Best regards,

Kontiki, Inc. and Melcrum
