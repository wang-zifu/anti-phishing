Hi Amy,

As I mentioned in my previous email, a new approach to loyalty has given our clients a better way of protecting the investments they make to both acquire and retain customers.

What are your plans for the coming year? How much will you spend on customer acquisition? What are you going to spend to retain your customers?




Do you have some time to discuss how we could help you ensure that the investments you make deliver an ROI that's both sustainable and truly measurable?

Best,
Eric
