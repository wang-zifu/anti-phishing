CNET | DOWNLOAD DISPATCH(Mac Edition)
July 9, 2015 
Vol. 7, No. 27

Using a Mac and today's music software, musicians are finding
that they can create, record, and master their songs without
the need to pay for expensive studio time. Deck, our Pick of
the Week, offers a multitrack audio workstation that can take 
care of all your recording needs, and it's even optimized for 
OS X. Not just great for music, Deck can be used for film, video,
and numerous other applications. Get on Deck:

Also this week, we've got Captain FTP, for an easy way to
transfer files; AquilaCalendar, to get you organized under OS X;
Tex-domain.com Plus, a full-featured alternative to the pricier
text editors; and Boom, a remake of one of the great classic
arcade games.

Enjoy!

2. Pick of the Week

   DECK
   Version: 3.5
   File size: 6.6MB
   License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X

   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
   soundtracks, domain.com dialogue, spot effects, and record
   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on
   Deck:

3. The Week in Wares

   IN INTERNET:

   CAPTAIN FTP
   Version: 1.3
   File size: 793K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
   book, and integrated domain.com links. The interface deserves
   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:

   IN HOME AND EDUCATION:

   AQUILACALENDAR
   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

   TEX-EDIT PLUS
   Version: 4.1.3
   File size: 1.17MB
   License: Free to try; $15.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: System 7.x

   Before you spend the big bucks on a HTML editor, make sure
   you check out Tex-domain.com Plus. This handy little editor offers
   all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands,
   translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,
   and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be
   able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client
   such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or domain.com. Text
   editing made easy:

   BOOM
   Version: 1.3
   File size: 2.3MB
   License: Free to try, $15 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 8.x/OS 9.x/OS X

   Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
   from. Blast away:
