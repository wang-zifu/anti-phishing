Senator Bernie Sanders has a noble cause i.e.to expand Medicare for all Ame
ricans , to provide free government funded college tuitions at public colle
ges  for all who want to go,  expand social security, infrastructure fundin
g of roads and bridges, all for a minimal cost of $18 trillion .  Add that 
number to an already existing $18 t  federal debt and the appearance in fro

eventually be non-existent. Healthcare at $15 trillion, we would have to re
name OBAMACARE  as BERNIECARE[Sure President Obama would support that] . It
 is simply not even remotely economically feasible in both in  healthcare a
