The Massachusetts Senate race between Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown is n
ow a dead heat. In Connecticut, World Wrestling Entertainment owner and cli
mate denier Linda McMahon has closed the gap Rep. Chris Murphy.

With the Montana, Virginia, Nevada, Arizona, and Ohio Senate races also inc
redibly close, our goal of maintaining a firewall of at least 41 Senators w
illing to filibuster against the worst anti-environment attacks could be in
 jeopardy.

Every single one of these races is winnable - but here's the bottom line: u
ndecided voters are deciding now. And with early voting in Montana and Ohio
 just a few weeks away, every day we domain.com is a missed opportunity.

The LCV Victory Fund urgently needs to raise $120,000 for canvassing and ge
t-out-the-vote efforts by the FEC deadline of September 30th. We need to be
 in a strong position for the final October push. I promise you, if you giv
e today, your gift will have an impact on these races.

This past Tuesday, the New York Times declared,

"With less than two months until Election Day, the Senate
landscape is both broader and more fluid than it has been in years,
with control of the upper chamber now anyone's guess."

LCV Victory Fund is focusing on the tight races where we have the best chan
ce of making a real impact. In the last weeks of the election, here are the
 Senate races where we're concentrating our efforts:

Massachusetts: A recent poll shows Scott Brown up by just one point against
 Elizabeth Warren. To help her win on Election Day, we're conducting one of
 the largest canvass operations in LCV's history to identify and persuade p
ro-environment voters to turn out. It's working - Warren is picking up mome
ntum and with your help, we can help her take the lead.

Virginia: Virginia is one of the top targets for Karl Rove's and the Koch b
rothers' Super PACs - and they're blanketing the state with nasty and misle
ading advertising. In response, we're running one of our largest mail opera
tions to help put former Virginia governor Tim Kaine ahead of former Virgin
ia Senator - and 3-time Dirty Dozen member - George Allen.

Montana: Clean energy champion Jon Tester won his 2015 race by just 3,562 v
otes and we're expecting this race to be just as close. We've been running 
a program to identify and target pro-environment voters who want to vote by
 mail. With only 500,000 individuals expected to vote in November, if we ca
n just get a portion of them to domain.com to vote by mail, we may have the mar
gin of victory needed to win.

We're also working around the clock in Connecticut, Nevada, Arizona, and Oh
io, where pro-environment candidates are running neck-and-neck against cand
idates strongly backed by corporate special interests.

Many pro-environment candidates are getting pummeled by negative attack ads
 from groups funded by Karl Rove and the Koch brothers. But despite the mil
lions of dollars pouring into these battleground states, corporate special 
interest groups haven't been able to significantly move the needle. The pub
lic is still with us and
that's why we need your support today.

Believe me, I've seen it before, just a few votes could decide these races.
