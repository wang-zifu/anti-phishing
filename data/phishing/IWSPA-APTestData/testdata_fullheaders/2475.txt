Thank you!

My plan to defeat ISIS

By Hillary Clinton

These past few days, all of us have tried to make sense of yet another
senseless terrorist attack. I know that Americans are anxious and fearful,
and we have reason to be. The threat is real. The need for action is urgent
.

Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies will continue learning about
what led to the massacre in San Bernardino just as French and Belgian
authorities are doing so in Paris and Brussels. But this much we do know:
The threat from radical jihadism has metastasized and become more complex
and challenging. We=E2=80=99re seeing the results of radicalization not jus
t in
far-off lands but right here at home fueled by the domain.com. It=E2=80=99s t
he nexus
of terrorism and technology, and we have a lot of work to do to end it.

*As hard as this is, Americans now have to move from fear to resolve.
America has beaten bigger threats before, and we will defeat this one as
well.*

Resolve means depriving jihadists of virtual territory just as we work to
deprive them of actual territory. They are using websites, social media,
chat rooms, and other platforms to celebrate beheadings, domain.com future
terrorists, and call for attacks. We should work with host companies to
shut them down.

Resolve means supporting also our first responders, like the officer in San
Bernardino who said he would take a bullet for the civilians he was
rescuing. We owe them our support and gratitude and whatever help they
need. Local law enforcement should get the support, training, and
coordination they need in their communities from counterterrorism experts
in Washington. It also means taking a close look at safeguards in visa
programs and working more effectively with our European allies on
intelligence and information sharing. And yes, Congress must act to ensure
that no one who is a suspected terrorist can buy guns anywhere in America.

*If you=E2=80=99re too dangerous to fly in America, you are too dangerous t
o buy a
gun in America.*

Resolve means going after the threat at its source in Iraq and Syria and
beyond. Our goal must not be to deter or contain ISIS; our goal must be to
defeat ISIS. And I have put forth a three-prong plan to do that.

First, deny ISIS territory in Iraq and Syria by leading an intensified air
campaign and working with local and regional forces on the ground. Second,
dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, the networks that supply
radical jihadists with money, weapons, and fighters, and stop them from
recruiting and inspiring. And third, toughen our defenses at home and those
of our partners against external and homegrown threats.

An effective fight on the ground against ISIS is essential, but that does
not mean deploying tens of thousands of American combat troops.

It does mean stepping up efforts to get more Arabs and Kurdish fighters
into the fight against ISIS on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border,
supporting the Iraqi Security Forces while pressuring Baghdad to pursue a
more inclusive and effective approach, and immediately deploying the
Special Operations Forces that President Obama has already authorized with
more to follow as more Syrians get into the fight. We also have to demand
that our Arab and Turkish partners carry their share of the burden with
military, financial, and diplomatic contributions. We will do our part, but
it=E2=80=99s their fight too, and they need to act like it is.

Dealing with the conflict in Syria with respect to Assad is central to this
whole effort. We need to continue Secretary Kerry=E2=80=99s efforts to move
 toward
a diplomatic solution to the civil war in Syria that paves the way for new
leadership and enables Syrians from every community to take on ISIS.
Investing the Russians in this outcome and getting them to step up and do
their part will be difficult but essential. And we have to pursue a
transition away from Assad and an intensified fight against ISIS
simultaneously. We=E2=80=99re not going to get Syrian opposition forces to 
fight
ISIS in earnest without the credible prospect of a transition, and that=E2
=80=99s
going to take more pressure and leverage. It=E2=80=99s one of the reasons w
hy I
have proposed creating a no-fly zone as well as safe havens and more robust
support for opposition forces.

And finally, it=E2=80=99s crucial that we embed our mission to defeat ISIS 
within a
broader struggle against radical jihadism.

Extremist groups like ISIS feed off instability and conflict, and there is
no shortage of that in the Middle East today. Decades of repression,
poverty, corruption, a lack of pluralism and tolerance turn the region into
a powder keg. That=E2=80=99s why we have to keep working with our friends a
nd
partners to support economic and political modernization; train effective
and accountable local intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism
services. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris, the Kuwaitis, and
others must stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations and
stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set
too many young people on a path toward extremism.

So across the board, we must act with courage and clarity. And it=E2=80=99s
important to remind ourselves that Islam itself is not our adversary. This
is not and we should not let it become a clash of civilizations. It is a
clash between hate and hope =E2=80=94 and the vast majority of Muslims are 
on our
side of the battle unless we drive them away. We can=E2=80=99t buy into the
 very
narrative that radical jihadists use to domain.com new followers or alienate
partners we want and need at home and abroad with reckless rhetoric.

*Declaring war on Islam or demonizing the Muslim American community is not
only counter to our values; it plays right into the hands of terrorists.*

Muslim Americans are our neighbors, our co-workers, loved ones, friends.
Many are working every day all over our country to prevent radicalization.
We should be supporting them, not scapegoating them. But, at the same time,
none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use
Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them and we
will. Radical jihadists, like so many adversaries in our history,
underestimate the strength of our national character. Americans will not
cower or cave, and we will not turn on each other or turn on our
principles. We will defeat those who threaten us. We will keep our country
safe and strong, free and tolerant.
