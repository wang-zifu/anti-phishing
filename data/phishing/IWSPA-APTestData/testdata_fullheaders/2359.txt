When reviewing the Toshiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA.
