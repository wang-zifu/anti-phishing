The two gold tickets and 2 of the party tix should be charged to company.




Other charges should be designated as personal and deducted

I need to know who the other 3 attendees are for the Exp. Report.  I’m assuming Fred is one. 




Also, last year you charged 2 tickets on your personal card. Is that the case this year?




Thanks.

Hi Shannon,




I am actually no longer in the ticketing department, but my associate Richard should be able to assist you with your request for a receipt.
