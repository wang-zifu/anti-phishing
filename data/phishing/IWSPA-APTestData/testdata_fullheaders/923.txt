There's some folks on our team who never volunteer or who respond with sass whenever I ask, and it isn't going to change if the requests keep coming from me.

SL: 2 volunteers needed for monitoring tomorrow

Body: We need 2 volunteers to monitor tomorrow from 8pm-midnight (or whenever coverage ends). If you haven't volunteered lately or at all, please pick up your slack and volunteer for tomorrow night or we'll assign it to whoever has volunteered the least. Thanks.
