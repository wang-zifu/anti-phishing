Yes. We can debunk. While money has obviously been spent for fundraising costs (which is absolutely necessary in order to raise the 60 million dollars they keep referencing!) there are millions of dollars still sitting in HVF that are allocated to the Organizationand the state parties (and therefore have to be transferred to the Organizationand the state parties) that have not yet been distributed because the point of the party portion of HVF is to raise money to fund the general election. This isn't right and it seems to me that we should say that. Let me reach out to see if I can get hard numbers on how much is left.
