By Michael Kranish and Farah Stockman
Responding to the turmoil on Wall Street, John McCain said flatly yesterday

Out of bounds! McCain stretches definition of 'fundamentals' (McClatchy
Newspapers 9/17/08)
By David Lightman
Throw the flag against: John McCain. Call: False start. What happened:
Republican presidential nominee McCain said Monday, as financial markets
were reeling, "The fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are
very, very difficult times."  ...Why that's wrong: Economists, politicians
and journalists have long referred to economic "fundamentals" as
quantifiable concepts, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product,
inflation, productivity and so forth.

''The fundamentals of our economy are strong," John McCain said as

*John McCain and the Lying Game (TIme 9/18/08)*
By Joe Klein
Politics has always been lousy with blather and chicanery. But there
are rules and traditions too. In the early weeks of the
general-election campaign, a consensus has grown in the political
community=97a consensus that ranges from practitioners like Karl Rove to
commentators like, well, me=97that John McCain has allowed his campaign to
slip the normal bounds of political propriety. The situation has gotten so
intense that we in the media have slipped our normal rules as well.
... increasing numbers of otherwise sober observers, even such august
institutions as the New York Times editorial board, are calling John McCain
a liar.  ...Are his transgressions of degree or of kind?

by Ari Berman
Back in the 1980s, when the US faced a major savings & loan crisis, John
McCain intervened to protect S&L magnate Charles Keating--a major McCain
donor and friend--from federal regulators. McCain was later rebuked by the
Senate Ethics Committee for "poor judgement" and embarrassed by the $112,00

Following the entanglement, McCain became a born-again reformer and tried t
