RE: ROBOCOP - P&A Budget

Joni – 




Checking in. Do you have the updated ROBOCOP international budget(s) you were expecting?




Also, any changes to the July domestic budget? Do you mind sending the us the detail of “Other Releasing Costs” (which were $4,360K on the July budget).




Thanks

Jose

I take that back – Gina has just requested the pre-plans from the territories, so we should have more current information in December for international.  In addition there are no changes to domestic since July.  Thanks.

Sony – do you have an updated P&A budget for both domestic and international re: ROBOCOP that you can share with MGM? (I believe we have a version dated July). Thanks.




Jose
