                         Dear Amy,



            The next 10 days could alter the future of America, Israel, and the world.



            The Iranian nuclear deadline is looming on November 24. A deal that gives Iran a path to nuclear weapons puts everything we hold dear at risk.



            TIP’s President and CEO Josh Block is traveling to Vienna for next week’s nuclear talks to represent all of us who are committed to keeping Iran from going nuclear. By helping us raise $10,000 by Nov. 24, you can help us make the fight to stop Iran as strong as it can possibly be.



            Will you donate now to help TIP fight Iran’s deadly nuclear ambitions?



            Stopping Iran’s nuclear weapons program should be our number one priority. Here’s what we’re doing:



                Our petition to tell Washington: No path to a bomb or no deal has received more than 13,000 signatures.
                We’ve connected reporters and lawmakers with top Iran experts through exclusive conference call briefings.
                We’ve bought high-profile digital ads and billboard space to hammer home the message that a nuclear Iran threatens the world's security.



            TIP is working around the clock to get the truth out about Iran’s nuclear program — and the need to shut down Iran’s ability to race toward nuclear weapons.



            But we need to raise $10,000 by Nov. 24 to fund our No Bomb for Iran campaign.



            Will you join your voice with ours by donating now to help stop an Iranian nuclear bomb?



            Nothing is more important than keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of Iran and its terror network. Time is running out.



            The world can't afford to make a mistake. Help TIP fight Iran’s deadly nuclear ambitions.



            Please, donate now.



            Thank you for your support.



            The Israel Project
