Dear Colleagues.

I am sorry to report that we will be experiencing noise from intermittent j
ackhammering today and possibly later this week. The gas company has discov
ered some unexpected subsurface concrete that has to be broken and removed.
 Classes in Hotung will be affected the most. I am sorry if this disrupts y
our class. It has disrupted mine this morning although I was able to teach 
through it.

Wally Mlyniec
