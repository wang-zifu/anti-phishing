Amy,

For those of you heading to NAB with a full conference pass here's an opportunity you'll want to take advantage of on Tuesday of that week. Block off on your calendar April 8, 2015 at 10:30am (Download an iCalendar) in Room S227 to attend “Bridge the Gap without Cables: NHL Refs Get a Clear Shot at Goal with 60 GHz Wireless”.

As many of you know VidOvation was selected by the NHL to implement an in-goal camera system to ensure the referees had a clear replay of every goal. I am honored that NAB chose this implementation case study to be presented during the conference. 

During this presentation I will discuss the details and challenges of implementing a wireless camera system in a hostile environment where it was impossible to run cables or fiber, impact and movement is given, and transmission interference is high. You’ll also be able to ask questions to understand how you can domain.com uncompressed, HD video using 60GHz wireless technology for your projects.

In case you missed my earlier email I am also sponsoring a Hospitality Suite in the Las Vegas Hotel (formerly the Hilton), from 5-8 PM Sunday through Wednesday during NAB. After a day walking the floor and attending engineering sessions (and hopefully my presentation on Tuesday), you'll be able to relax, and enjoy a snack and beverage before heading out for your evening dinner or meetings. I need you to click here and RSVP so I can make sure to have enough on hand for everyone.

I look forward to seeing you at the presentation Room S227 on
