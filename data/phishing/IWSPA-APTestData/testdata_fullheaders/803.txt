Great. Thanks Terry. On point 1, we agree and will try to push more. On
point 2, I hope I didn't sound defeatist. I believe we will win in NH, just
trying not to seem like I am oblivious to current polls. I remember that
President Bradley and President Dean were ahead at this time in their
cycles as well.
