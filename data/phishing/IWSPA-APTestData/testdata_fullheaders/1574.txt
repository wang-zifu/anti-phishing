Eric drafted this last night

SL: Is Thin-Skinned Trump's Prez Run an Attempt at Payback for 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner?

Body: From the New York Times<<<link>>>:

That evening of public abasement, rather than sending Mr. Trump away, accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world. And it captured the degree to which Mr. Trump's campaign is driven by a deep yearning sometimes obscured by his bluster and bragging: a desire to be taken seriously.

So in addition to rescuing the U.S. economy, rescuing the auto industry, creating 14 million new jobs, getting unemployment under 5%, getting health coverage to 20 million Americans while slowing the growth of health costs, killing Osama Bin Laden and 30,000 other terrorists, President Obama may have ensured a Democratic successor using nothing but his comedic chops.

Thanks, Obama!
