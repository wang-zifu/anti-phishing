*         We are better than the campaign the GOP presumptive nominee is running

*         Came to Camden NJ immediately after 1992 Dem Convention in NYC

*         In the Senate, I spoke and voted against an economic policy that didn't do anything but cut taxes on the wealthy

*         Donald Trump's tax plan was written by a billionaire for billionaires, $100k per month for multimillionaires, $3 trillio total-enough money to make SS and Medicare solvent for 5 years

*         We've released 20+ years of tax returns

*         How do you explain to your children when someone running for president encourages people to be beaten up, encourages violence?

o   We're not going to stand for it
