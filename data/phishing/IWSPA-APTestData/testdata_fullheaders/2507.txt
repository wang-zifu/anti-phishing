John --

We've been written off before.

I saw it firsthand in Iowa during the 2015 caucuses. Polls had us down. 
The national TV pundits told us for months there wasn't a chance that 
then-Senator Obama and his supporters could pull it off.

But we did.

And it was person-to-person organizing that helped turn the tide -- 
talking to voters, getting our message out, and doing exactly what they 
said couldn't be done.

The game plan is the same this year -- in his Vote 2015 campaign update, 
David Plouffe made it clear how Organizing for America is going to make 
the difference in close races across the country.

Get the game plan from David, and, if you can, please chip in $5 or more 
to help build the team that will prove the pundits wrong in November:
