John:

Ann might have already written you. If so, I apologize, just trying to move
extremely fast to get this organized.

We need a senior campaign person to be with Hillary @ the Aug 6th Tech
Roundtable from 11am to 12:30pm for support and facilitation. Brief on the
invite we are sending out below, will be ~15 Silicon Valley leader (invite
list will be final tomorrow). Not that we are better choices (we are not)
but Ann, Teddy and I cannot be there. I know you'll already be in SF, can
you take on this role?

Thanks,
Steph
