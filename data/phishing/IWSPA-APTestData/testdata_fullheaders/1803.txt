Dear Steven, 

Everyone is an advocate. Become a champion today!

These are words we live by at Autism Speaks, and they’ve never been more important. That’s true whether you’re a volunteer, parent, friend or loved one of someone with autism, or on the autism spectrum yourself.

Today, I am proud to announce the official launch of our Autism Champions website. With the click of a button, you can now connect directly to your federal and state lawmakers to make our community's priorities heard.

I invite you to the domain.com the website HERE.

For a quick tutorial, watch this fun video HERE.
