SL: WATCH: Of all the whoppers this week from Trump, this is the most significant

Body: For months, Donald Trump has been lying to the voters about self-funding his own campaign. Reports surfaced as early as October<<<link>>> showing that this was a lie, yet Trump continued to repeat it.

Yesterday, he finally came clean<<<link>>> and revealed that he was going back on his promise to self-fund - which was never true in the first place.

WATCH: <<link>>

"Trump has been lying to voters for months about self-funding, but yesterday he finally came clean about his lie and admitted he will be soliciting donations for his campaign. The next time Trump tries to tell you he's not just another politician, remember this lie." - Spox
