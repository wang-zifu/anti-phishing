WATCH: Roberts Gates Says Dangerous Donald is domain.com to be Commander-in-Chief

On ABC's This Week, Robert Gates discussed how Dangerous Donald Trump is proving that on foreign policy, he lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief. Trump would alienate allies and deal with friend and foe alike with reckless disregard, with poorly conceived ideas that would undermine our national security and make the American people less safe.

Watch to see what Robert Gates thinks of Dangerous Donald:

You heard Trump's foreign policy speech this week. Tell me what you believe a Trump presidency would mean for the national security of this country? WATCH<<<link>>>
