*MEDIA ADVISORY*
TOMORROW at 3:00 PM ET: Representative Mark Pocan and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten Host a Press Call To Discuss The Disastrous GOP Education Agenda during Teacher Appreciation Week

Tomorrow, Representative Mark Pocan and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten will host a press call to discuss the disastrous GOP education agenda during Teacher Appreciation Week.

It's clear that the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump stands against education. From the fraudulent Trump University to calling for the end of the Department of Education and Common Core, education is threatened by Trump. But Donald Trump is not alone, as his disastrous agenda on education is a reflection of failed GOP policies.

Now more than ever, Democrats are the party that supports teachers and the future of education. Tomorrow, Representative Mark Pocan and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten will discuss what is at stake for our country's education system looking towards the general election.

WHO: Representative Mark Pocan
            American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten

WHAT: Press Call

WHEN: TOMORROW, May 5th at 3:00 PM ET

RSVP: Please email Jenna Price, at user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> for dial-in information
