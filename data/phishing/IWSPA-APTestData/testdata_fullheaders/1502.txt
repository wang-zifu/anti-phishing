In just 14 days, Democrats will have a historic chance to win a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia. 




            Amy --



            "Defend it? I'm proud of it."
            That was the response Georgia's Republican Senate candidate David Perdue gave when asked to defend his remark that he spent most of his career outsourcing jobs to places like China and Mexico.
            We know firsthand how one out-of-touch comment can change the dynamics of a race, and sure enough, Perdue's race against strong Democrat Michelle Nunn is now one of the most competitive Senate contests this cycle -- and one of Democrats' best opportunities to pick up a Republican seat.
            Michelle Nunn can defeat Perdue, but she needs an infusion of grassroots support, right now. Will you step up -- and help make sure she has the resources to win this important Senate seat?
            Help Michelle Nunn pick up a Republican Senate seat in Georgia's neck-and-neck Senate race by contributing $3 now.
            The Koch brothers and other right-wing groups have spent millions on ads attacking Michelle. As someone who won a tough race in a red state against that kind of opposition, I know how hard she'll have to fight.
            And I can see why these outside attack groups are supporting David Perdue. In addition to the outsourcing, federal investigators discovered that while Perdue was in charge, Dollar General violated the law by paying female employees less than their male counterparts -- while Perdue himself pocketed $40 million.
            The Senate needs Michelle, someone who supports the education and infrastructure investments that will create jobs here in America.
            In just 14 days, Georgians will have a historic chance to send a Democrat to the Senate for the first time in decades -- and send a woman for the first time since 1922.
            Contribute $3 now to help Michelle Nunn defeat career outsourcer David Perdue and send a woman to the Senate from Georgia for the first time in over 90 years!
            I've been keeping my eye on this race, waiting to see if it would pop. Well, it's ready. This is now one of the best Democratic pickup opportunities in the country -- and together, we can help bring it home.
            Thank you for your support,
            Claire
