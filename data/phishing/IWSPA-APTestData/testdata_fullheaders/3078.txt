Dear John -

Hope this email finds you well! It's been a long time since our meeting
at CAP -  I'm really appreciative that you spent time brainstorming career
opportunities with me!

For the last couple of years, I've been working at State as a senior
advisor at the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Recently, I
reached out to the HRC office to express my interest and to see if I might
be of service to a possible HRC campaign.

I'm enthusiastic to help Secretary Clinton in any way that I can (and
especially foreign policy, where it's a particular area of interest for
me). In addition, I can serve as a surrogate for the campaign, particularly
in key states, with women and the Asian American community.

If you have any advice, suggestions or ideas for next steps, I'd greatly
welcome them with open arms!!

With appreciation,

Michelle
