Hey John, good catching up at dinner Thursday.

I wanted to give you a heads up that President Clinton called me late
yesterday and we ended having a lengthy conversation about how HRC
might best  engage with voters/media going forward.

I expressed my point of view about how she's at her very best when she
engages directly with voters in Q+A forums.

I shared with him your idea about doing these as media sponsored town
halls in order to insure wide coverage and distribution. He was
extremely enthusiastic and thought your approach to this would be
perfect for her.

I told him I was certain you were going to be discussing it with HRC ASAP.

I do think your idea is great for her and I believe if you could have
her doing one of these a day for the next few weeks you could very
well turn the narrative on her in a very different direction.

Please let me know if I can be of any help. Let's chat after your
lunch on Monday.

Best
