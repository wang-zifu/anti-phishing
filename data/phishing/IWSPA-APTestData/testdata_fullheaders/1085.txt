Trump Leads GOP Field, But More Think Bush Will Win

For Immediate Release

Contact: Megan Waring, user@domain.com, (631) 942-9820

WASHINGTON =E2=80=93 A new poll conducted by Morning Consult, Washington=E2
=80=99s leading
publication for professional political insiders, shows real estate mogul
Donald Trump leading the field =E2=80=93 but more Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents who say they plan to participate in the
presidential nominating process believe former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R)
will win the Republican primary.

Trump leads the Republican field with 24 percent of the vote, more than the
13 percent who say they plan to vote for Bush. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker
(R) is the choice of 9 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners, while
retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson comes in fourth place with 8 percent of the
vote.

Fifteen percent of Republican voters =E2=80=93 including 20 percent of thos
e who
say they will vote for Trump =E2=80=93 say Bush is their second choice. Ten
 percent
choose former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) as their second choice.

Fewer Republicans believe Trump will actually win the nomination. The poll
shows 25 percent of Republican voters believe Bush will win; 19 percent
think Trump is the favorite for the nomination; and 9 percent say Walker
will emerge on top. No other Republican candidate gets more than 4 percent.

=E2=80=9CDonald Trump holds a significant lead among Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents,=E2=80=9D said Morning Consult pollster Kyl
e Dropp.
=E2=80=9CHowever, there are key signs of strength for Jeb Bush. More Republ
ican
registered voters believe Bush will win the nomination than Trump, more
Republicans say they would definitely not vote for Trump than for Bush, and
Bush is the second choice for more Republicans than Trump.=E2=80=9D

On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads the
field by a wide margin. Fifty-nine percent of Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents say they will vote for Clinton, while just
16 percent said they will choose Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont
independent running for president. And two-thirds of those voters, 66
percent, say they believe Clinton will win the Democratic primary.

In the general election, Clinton leads every Republican candidate tested,
though she is below the critical 50 percent mark. Clinton leads Bush by a
45 percent to 39 percent margin; she takes 46 percent against both Walker,
who takes 37 percent, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who receives 38
percent. Clinton leads Trump by a narrower 46 percent to 41 percent margin.
More Americans view Clinton in a favorable light, 46 percent, than any of
her possible Republican rivals, though an even greater number =E2=80=93 48 
percent
=E2=80=93 say they have an unfavorable view of her.

The poll also shows just 41 percent of Americans approve of the job
President Obama is doing, while 55 percent say they disapprove.

The Morning Consult national tracking poll was conducted July 23-27 among a
national sample of 1,979 registered voters. The poll, conducted online,
carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. The poll
included a subsample of 750 Republicans and Republican-leaning
independents, which carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.57
percent. The subsample of 872 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents
carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.32 percent.
