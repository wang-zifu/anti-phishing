=C2=B7         Refund and exchange restrictions and penalties for failure t

you must cancel your reservation at least 24 hours prior to the train's
departure in order to be eligible for a full refund. If the reservation is
canceled within 24 hours of departure, a refund fee will apply. If the
reservation is not canceled prior to scheduled departure ("no show"), the
entire amount paid for the reservation will be forfeited. See the
refund/exchange policy at domain.com/refund.
