Hillary Clinton Emails Give Peek into Personal Life, Habits and Style

BY SANDRA SOBIERAJ WESTFALL
 @sswestfall <<<link>>>

05/22/2015 AT 04:20 PM EDT
James Bond had Q. Barack Obama had H.

In the 296 Hillary Clinton
<<<link>>,,personsTax:HillaryRodhamClin
ton,00.html>
emails
released Friday afternoon by the State Department, we see a lot of
backstage back-and-forth discussion
<<<link>>> of the deadly
2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.

We also get a rare peek at some of the peculiarities of her daily life as
President Obama's secretary of state =E2=80=93 starting with the fact that,
 in
email, her staff addressed her, simply, as "H."

And with the famously buttoned-up former First Lady, some staffers were
fairly casual in their parlance.

On Dec. 20, 2012, as she was at home recovering from a concussion due to a
fall <<<link>>,,20657095,00.html>, Clinton
emailed two top aides, Thomas Nides and William Burns, who were headed to
Capitol Hill to testify before Congress on her behalf.

"I'll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you 'remain calm
and carry on!' " Clinton wrote.

Nides wrote back with shoddy punctuation and spelling: "Thanks I wish I
could tell u I am looking forward to this but it would be a lie! Get
better...."

Then there are the idiosyncrasies of Clinton's tightly scheduled days.
Clinton's daily planner from her scheduler was often broken down into
5-minute blocks (as in the five minutes Clinton was to "drop by" the
surprise birthday party of communications strategist Philippe Reines) and
included the day's weather report, plus the planned overnight whereabouts
of Clinton and her husband.

The schedule for Nov. 26, 2012, noted: "HRC RON Washington, DC; WJC RON
Chappaqua, NY."

Translation: Hillary Rodham Clinton, remain overnight Washington, DC;
William Jefferson Clinton, remain overnight Chappaqua, NY.

That same schedule quaintly listed Undersecretary Pat Kennedy as Clinton's
"plus one" for an afternoon meeting in the White House Situation Room.

Perhaps the most colorful commentary in the entire collection comes from
Reines, describing for colleagues how Monica Langley of *The Wall Street
Journal* moved her chair uncomfortably close to Clinton during an Oct. 10,
2012, interview in the Secretary's outer office at the State Department:

"...she moved that yellow chair as close as it went. Knee to knee. Amazed
she didn't try knee in between knee. And if that wasn't enough, she leaned
forward. More like a pivot, as far as her torso could fold forward to
minimize the space between their heads. Was like the dental hygienist
rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on
what tooth she was trying to get access to I've never seen a Westerner
invade her space like that And even the non Westerners I've seen do it
based on cultural differences have been only briefly to greet, This went on
like that for 51 minutes =E2=80=93 unacceptable in any culture. I don't eve
n think
you see that behavior among any type of mammal. The touching the leg and
repeatedly calling her 'Hillary' was just gravy. But it was wonderful. One
of the best interviews I've ever witnessed. Wish it were on live tv."

The emails, which you can read for yourself here
<<<link>>>, are
just the first batch of some 30,000 pieces of electronic correspondence
Clinton turned over to State from her controversial private server
<<<link>>

.

From the presidential campaign trail
<<<link>>> on
Friday, Clinton said of the remaining emails that she is pressing the State
Department to release "all of them as soon as possible."
