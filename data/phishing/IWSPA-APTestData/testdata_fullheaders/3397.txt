Hi team,

Starting tomorrow the basement bathroom will be closed for renovations. We wanted to give your departments advanced warning since your teams will be impacted the most by this closure. The bathroom will be closed tomorrow, May 12th and through the weekend as well.  The bathroom should be functional starting next Monday, May 16th. Once the renovations start, Operations will send an all staff email alerting the building that the bathroom will be offline.

Thanks,

Mally
