NY: SAG Q&A Tonight

Our American Hustle SAG Q&A just ended and it was fantastic! The theater was packed and the audience was enamored with the commentary between Scott Foundas, David O. Russell, Bradley Cooper, and Alessandro Nivola. The film played really well with lots of applause at the end and throughout the credits. The audience all stayed for the Q and A.

Scott started out by asking David what the end of the ice fishing story which got a big laugh from the audience. David said that Louis C.K. told the ending on Leno and that the audienceÂ  should check it out. Scott went into saying that the movie was a potluck and David talked about how unique all of the characters are. 

David announced it was Bradley's birthday and then he and audience sang Happy Birthday to Bradley! 

Bradley then discussed what a David O. Russell set was like. Alessandro and Bradley talked about what it was like working together and with David as both a director and writer.

David talked about the lessons he's learned...working with actors throughout the years and how he developed his method of shooting. Bradley talked about playing Richie and how there were little things that made the character special. 

Scott then asked the audience for some questions. One member asked why it took so long for the movie to be made and David said he didn't really know but movies get made when they're supposed to get made. Another one asked about working with Robert De Niro and Bradley said that he's as hungry as anybody else despite everything he's already done. They talked about the theme of survival that's found in The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle and the soundtrack for the movie. 

Bradley, David and Alessandro graciously took photos with various SAG members as they exited the theater. 

Overall, a really great Q&A!
