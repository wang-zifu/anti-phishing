Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths 

A reporter came by the domain.com <<<link>>>  offices
last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use
<<<link>>> LindowsOS to
write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office
used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.  

I turned on the domain.com <<<link>>> computer
and then clicked on the running man  <<<link>>>
which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse
<<<link>>>  where I installed OpenOffice
<<<link>>>  using Click-N-Run. I then clicked
the "Run It"  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer.
I then typed "Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save
hundreds using LindowsOS." I selected "Save as Microsoft Word."

The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,
he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple
word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For
Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to
overcome a couple of myths. 

The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That
may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the
latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5
minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating
system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at <<<link>>> .  

The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the
graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.
Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps
over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading
and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these
products is via the Click-N-Run  <<<link>>>
Warehouse.

 Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in
the Warehouse <<<link>>> all downloaded and
installed with a single click:

OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an
impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open
the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to domain.com files and
swap them with Microsoft counterparts. <www.lindows.com/openoffice>
Programs included are:

OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) 
OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) 
OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)
OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program

Click here <<<link>>>  for a great
tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice.

GIMP <www.lindows.com/gimp> If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop,
you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor. 



Evolution <www.lindows.com/evolution> For those used to Microsoft's
Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check
out how easy it is to use <<<link>>> .

Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a  rich
charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and
organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, domain.com
Flowchart Pro at <<<link>>>

This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the
Warehouse <www.lindows.com/warehouse> that make Linux a practical choice
for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the
math.

<<<link>>> 
For  a total cost of $499 <<<link>>> , including
all  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete
system. 

With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped
systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars
stretched much further running LindowsOS.

Bringing Choice to Your Computer! 

LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
offered from domain.com  <<<link>>> Builder
partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
and preview to domain.com  <<<link>>> Insider
partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The
General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
and includes unique features such as a "Friendly-Install" alongside an
existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
select set of "bridge" Windows-compatible programs. For more information
