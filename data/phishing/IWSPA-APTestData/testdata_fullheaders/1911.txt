                               I'm looking for participants to complete an online survey as part of the research requirements for my PhD program at The University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia).



                               The study, "Exploring the decision to take a cruise", involves a multiple-choice survey looking at cruising behavior. The link below will take you to a secure site where you will find complete information about the study and will be able to begin the online survey.
