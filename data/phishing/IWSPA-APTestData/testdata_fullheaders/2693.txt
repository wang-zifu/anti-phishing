"We've seen it time and time again - the GOP's attempts to gain voters by stoking fear and prejudice. This latest round of anti-LGBT legislation like North Carolina's HB2 further institutionalizes bigotry and encourages harassment. Law enforcement experts agree there is no evidence of a transgender crime wave in bathrooms. Transgender Americans are one of the most at-risk groups targeted for violence, harassment, and discrimination, and they deserve protection under the law. The fact is, people should be more concerned about what Republican politicians are doing in public bathrooms."  -- Mark Paustenbach, Organizationspokesperson
