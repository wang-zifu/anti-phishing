Subject: Repeal Times 40

::: ProgressNow - Advancing Progressive Agendas, State by State :::

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Before going on their summer recess last week, the House GOP voted to
repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 40th time. The GOP's
continuous attacks on health care are not only happening on a national
level, our affiliates are seeing state actors actively discouraging
coverage as well. We are working hard to expose these conservative
politicians and ensure that all Americans have the access to the
quality health care that they deserve. These are just two of our 21
states doing what we do every day - make progress happen, and
happen NOW.

As always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to
us here.

Best,

Denise Cardinal
Executive Director

Granite State Progress Reveals Congressional Candidate Bill
O'Brien's Stance on the Affordable Care Act

On August 1st, Americans for Prosperity, one of the political
organizations funded by the Koch brothers, came through New Hampshire
as part of their national conservative campaign to discourage people
from accessing health care. They hosted an event featuring
Congressional candidate and former New Hampshire Speaker Bill
O'Brien, and he made his opposition to the Affordable Care Act
very clear. O'Brien compared the ACA to the Fugitive Slave Act,
which condoned human slavery. Specifically, O'Brien said that
Obamacare is "as destructive to personal and individual liberty
as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850". By linking the ACA to
slavery, conservatives such as Bill O'Brien are trying to
mislead voters and convince them to oppose the expansion of health
care coverage.

The AFP event was part of a larger campaign to dissuade uninsured
Americans from obtaining health coverage. The campaign is particularly
targeting young adult men and encouraging them to skip out on health
coverage. As executive director Zandra Rice Hawkins says,
"groups like Americans for Prosperity and politicians like Bill
O'Brien are trying to come between people and their doctors and
make health access as burdensome as possible, all so that they can use
health reform as a political wedge issue in the next election. We
refuse to let them play politics with people's lives." Contribute to
Granite State Progress to help stand up against this hurtful campaign
and instead promote the ACA and the beneficial coverage it will
provide for uninsured Americans.

Alliance for a Better Utah Speaks Out Against Senator Mike Lee's
Radical Tactic to Defund the Affordable Care Act

Utah Senator Mike Lee is attempting to defund the Affordable Care
Act's individual mandate by threatening a federal government
shutdown if Congress doesn't comply. Alliance for a Better Utah
isn't alone in thinking that this plan is outrageous.
Republicans such as Senator John McCain, Senator Mitch McConnell and
House Speaker John Boehner agree that this tactic is radical and
unnecessary. By making this threat, Lee is disregarding the bargain
that was made between the Obama administration, Congress, and the
insurance industry to pass the individual mandate.

<<link>>

Founder of Alliance for a Better Utah, Josh Kanter, explains in his
Salt Lake Tribue opinion piece that Lee's plan speaks to his
idea of governing.=A0 This action shows that Lee has a "lack
of respect for the deliberation and its results, and [refuses] to
abide by a democratic process of governing that is often built on
compromise". The fact that Republicans in Congress disagree with
Lee's tactics make it clear that he is not only out of touch
with voters and also those in his own party. Alliance for a Better
Utah is holding Lee accountable for his radical views, and believes
Utah would be better represented by someone=A0who will stand with
the moderate majority of Utahns.=A0
