I'm holding but to be clear, I'm not being difficult, the issue is that reporters are writing and it's 5:32 on a Friday, so they'll just publish without us. There are some we just won't get to if we don't have something to use.

User,
Please hold.  DWS is reviewing a different, more accurate statement for release.  When I have it back, I will send to you.
Thank you.

Can't keep holding. If you don't have updated language we need to continue to background reporters. If you have something new please send my way.

Hi User - Can you hold on this. We may want to change some of this based on what I am hearing here.
