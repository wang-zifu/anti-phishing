Hi Daniel,

You will arrive to Malpensa Airport, so you need to take the Malpensa Express (fast train - follow the indication at the airport) from Malpensa to Cadorna.
Cadorna is the last stop. Out of the station you can take a taxi to the Carlyle Brera Hotel, Corso Garibaldi, 84 - Milano- ph. (39) 02 29003888.

Should you need further information feel free to call me.

Thanks

Have a good trip!
Ciao
