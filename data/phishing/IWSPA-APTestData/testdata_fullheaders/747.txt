Manage Fatigue in a Nonstop World With a Nap

I didn’t get enough sleep one night recently. I realize that’s scarcely a big confession, but it’s a rare event for me. Because I’m acutely aware of how critical sleep is to my mood, focus, creativity and even my motivation, I’m usually vigilant about getting the sleep I require to wake up fully rested. 

On this occasion, I felt fine through a series of morning meetings. By midday, however, I noticed my energy dropping and my mind slowing down. I had a challenging piece of work left, but I couldn’t imagine taking it on. Instead, I decided to take a nap in the lounge chair I have in my office just for that purpose. 

I gave myself 20 minutes and was asleep for probably 15 of them. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. I had no trouble throwing myself into the work I’d earlier dreaded.
