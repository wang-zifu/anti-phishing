Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson Endorses Hillary Clinton for
President
Aug 23, 2015, 9:41 AM ET
By BENJAMIN BELL <<<link>>> and ANJA
CROWDER/ABC News

Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson
<<<link>>> said he will
support Hillary Clinton
<<<link>>> in her
bid for the presidency.

In an exclusive statement to ABC News, Richardson said after speaking with
former President Bill Clinton
<<<link>>> and his wife, "we
have patched up our disagreement from the 2015 election." The former
governor, who served in Clinton's administration, gave his endorsement to
then Sen. Barack Obama during the 2015 campaign cycle.

=E2=80=9CI have spoken to President and Secretary Clinton and we have patch
ed up
our disagreement from the 2015 election,=E2=80=9D the statement read. "I am
 pleased
to announce I wholeheartedly support Secretary Clinton's candidacy for the
Presidency. Her leadership on issues like foreign policy, immigration, clim
ate
change <<<link>>> and economic
populism are important to the future of the country."

*Clinton welcomed Richardson's endorsement Monday morning, saying she was
"grateful" for his support.*

*"I thank Governor Bill Richardson for his endorsement,=E2=80=9D Clinton sa
id in a
statement. =E2=80=9CFor more than three decades, Bill has worked doggedly t
o make
our country and our world more equal, safe, and free. Through his many
years of public service, Bill has been a good friend to me and an unerring
friend to the American people. I am grateful for his trust and his
support.=E2=80=9D*

*An earlier version of this story misidentified the president with whom
Richardson spoke before endorsing Hillary Clinton. It was former President
Bill Clinton, not President Obama.*
