Villain for a bond film

Dear Amy,

I know a Hollywood actress and model that would be the perfect villain for a bond film. She has strong energy in her eyes, she looks mysterious, dark, intelligent and powerful.

Her personality is very kind, loving, humble, intelligent and spiritual. She is also a friend of mine.

Would you like to see her IMDB profile?

Kind regards,
Bjarke Buurgaard Talamona
