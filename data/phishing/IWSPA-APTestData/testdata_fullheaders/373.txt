Anti-Bush Tour Bus Makes Its Debut <<<link>>
24/anti-bush-tour-bus-makes-its-debut/>

@ 3:05 pm by Chris Good <<<link>>>



Americans United for Change has long opposed many of President Bush's polici
es, but this year it's found a new way to say it-with a 28-ton bus.

The group today launched its Bush Legacy Bus, a rolling museum dedicated to 
the "worst policy failures" of the Bush administration. The bus will travel 
the country for the next five months, stopping in 150 cities and bearing a s
imple message: that Bush's policies have wreaked havoc on America.

The bus features interactive exhibits on the Iraq war, the economy, and heal
thcare. A screen displays images of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, wit
h captions that criticize the government's response. A chart entitled "not j
ust Bush's war" traces Iraq war support to House Minority Leader John Boehne
r (R-Ohio), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and former House
 Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas). The floor shows a timeline of events i
n the Bush presidency.

The bus is not just one group's effort. Its funding comes from a network of 
liberal interest groups that often work with Americans United for Change und
er the "progressive" umbrella: sponsors and partners include domain.com, Cen
ter for American Progress, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), AFL
-CIO, domain.com, and American Federation of State, County and Municipal E
mployees (AFSCME).

The bus will make its first stop in Dayton, Ohio tomorrow to campaign agains
t Boehner. It will domain.com Louisville, Ky. Thursday to campaign against McConn
ell.

"Eight years later, conservative government rule, of which President Bush se
rved as the vessel, has left an economy in recession, the costs for healthca
re, college tuition, food and gas skyrocketing and out of reach for most Ame
ricans," Americans United for Change President Brad Woodhouse said in a stat
ement that accompanied the bus's launch.

"But to be clear, this effort is not about Bush-it is about the conservative
 ideology he and his allies in Congress, including John McCain, represent," 
Woodhouse said.

The bus is part of the group's Bush Legacy Project, which has sought to to c
riticize of Bush since January, when the group aired a television ad <http:/
/www.americansunitedforchange.org/blog/entries/state_of_the_union/>  near th
e president's State of the Union address. The idea for the bus came in Febru
ary, and Americans United for Change has been planning its construction for 
the past several months, a spokesman said.

The group unveiled the bus today at a cookout in front of the AFL-CIO's nati
onal headquarters, across Lafayette Park from the White House. The bus then 
left for the Capitol, where it sat on display this afternoon.
