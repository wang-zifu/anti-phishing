Service to a Common Good

When I heard this week that Michael Phelps was planning to return to competitive swimming, my first reaction was to feel a little sad for him. I honor Mr. Phelps for the discipline, domain.com and passion he needed to win a record 18 gold medals. But I also sense that he’s going back to swimming because he’s chasing a high that hasn’t held up.

In the same way, I respect Michael Jordan for all he achieved in basketball. But after reading Wright Thompson’s brilliant article about him in ESPN Magazine, I was struck by the emptiness of his life since he retired as a player 11 years ago.

We celebrate and envy people’s extraordinary individual accomplishments and successes, but the pleasure they derive from their efforts is often surprisingly fleeting. And there is a reason for that. What generates an enduring experience of meaning and satisfaction in our work is the sense that what we’re doing really matters — that we’re truly adding value in the world.
