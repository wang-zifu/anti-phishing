John -

BREAKING NEWS ALERT: The NRCC announced they are funneling $100,000 into 
ads against Sean!

The good news is that some of our supporters are extending their donation 
match until midnight tonight to help us fight back against Boehner and the 
NRCC. But without your contribution to keep our ads up, there is no 
question: WE WILL LOSE.

If we're going to stop Congresswoman Hayworth from heading to Washington 
to help Boehner and his buddies, we're going to need to hit 'em with 
everything we've got. We're counting on you.

Thanks,

Maloney Ads Office
