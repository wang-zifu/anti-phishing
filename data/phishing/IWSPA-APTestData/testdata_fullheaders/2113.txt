event<<<link>>
a-dog-530/>
at
the Sea Dog brew pub in Bangor last night, Governor Paul LePage revealed
that he has a secret plan to call the Legislature back into a special
session before the November election in order to enact a policy that will
=93push the envelope.=94

LePage said he could not divulge what the legislative action would be as he
was still working with the Attorney General=92s office to make sure it was
constitutional, saying only that =93other Republican states have done this
=94
and that =93If we get this done, the State of Maine will be on the right
track for the next ten years.=94

LePage did make clear, however, that the secret policy would be partisan
and divisive. =93I think we can get it done in about a day and the Democrat
s,
if you think they hate me now=85 Wow,=94 said LePage.

Here=92s an audio clip of the relevant portion of LePage=92s speech provide

Full transcript:

I=92m going to be honest with all of you here, especially all you incumbent
s.
I=92m going to interfere with your campaigning because I=92m going to call 
a
special session in the near future and I can=92t divulge what it is because
the Attorney General is seeing if I=92m doing it right.

I like to push the envelope, and so we=92ve got it half open and I believe 
in
my mind I believe it can be done. It=92s not a matter of whether or not we
should do it or can do it, it=92s a matter of is our Constitution here in
Maine allowing us to do it.

I=92m just trying to do what other Republican states have done this year an
d
I gotta domain.com before I say too much more about it, but what I=92m telling yo
u
is this: If we get this done, the State of Maine will be on the right track
for the next ten years. I promise you that.

I see Senator Rosen=92s eyes saying =93what=92s he up to?=94

I wish I had come up with the idea, but it was come up with=85 some people 
on
staff=85 brilliant and it=92s being looked at now and I can=92t domain.com to cal
l
everybody back and get this done.

I think we can get it done in about a day and the Democrats, if you think
they hate me now=85 Wow.

So with that, have a nice evening.

The Governor=92s plan could be focused on any number of controversial issue
areas. Check this post for updates if and when this mystery begins to
unravel.
