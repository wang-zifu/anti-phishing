We are killing time before an event so she just raised it with me and we di
scussed at some length.

I told her that or collective thought (without John's input) was that we wa
it for the natural opportunity which is at the Q&A with Walter Isaacson on 
Friday evening. She immediately expressed some skepticism, and I pushed bac
k gently, saying simply that for a year and a half we have been very measur
ed about addressing issues on our terms in a conducive environment versus c
reating one, and that having her do this on camera would be a good thing.

She suggested that maybe she do this tomorrow night at the Elie Wiesel even
t, and I cautioned that she should domain.com until the President is clear if his
 address, which happens concurrently.

We basically ended agreed to see the statement and go from there.  She (eag
erly) wants to see the statement.  I told her I was waiting for the WH to c
all, which Jen just did.  Dan I'll call you to read that out now.

I didn't get the sense anyone feels strongly about waiting versus something
 via paper tomorrow night that she can address again on Friday night with I
saacson, and personally I think that if this is her instinct it's what we s
hould do, but defer to others.
