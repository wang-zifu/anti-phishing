The Volker Rule only bans transactions, not structures.  I think should cou
ld go farther to get to structures as well, domain.com with a bit of wiggle roo
m perhaps by allowing a more generous hold co structure such as what had ar
isen on the eve on GLB in the 1990s.  And yes, by imposing structural separ
ation, you are "downsizing," in that you are not allowing all that is curre
ntly under one roof to be under one roof.

Perhaps that puts me all the way at Warren;s bill -- I don't know it that w
ell -- but perhaps it is still short of that.  My point was that you can av
oid the flip flop claim here by ruling out a return to Glass Steagall itsel
f, while still giving Warren most of what she wants.

Thanks Ron. On Glass Steagall, that's what a stronger Volcker Rule does whi
ch is what she is for, but what about requiring banks to downsize?

I agree with you on TPP but others (including on this email!) feel strongly
 to the contrary.
