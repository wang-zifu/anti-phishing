we have a problem 

Hello all.

Throughout the day I have been tracking all 7 pieces of luggage...

Around 3:30pm, I noticed online that the luggage departed Memphis TN at 5:38, which worried me because it was due to arrive at 4:30pm in Montana. 

I called FedEx to investigate.  I told them I was Amy Pascal, Chairman of SPE, one of FedEx's largest accounts, which we use daily, etc...

After being on hold for 45 min, speaking to a customer service rep, then being transferred to a supervisor here is the update...

The luggage did NOT make it to Montana due to weather issues. 

I spoke to a very nice gentleman at FedEx, Big is his name.

He started a "Case" which means, that it is a top priority, I explained to him the urgency of the luggage, that I was traveling and all of my winter clothes for my family and I are in the 7 pieces of luggage and I HAD TO HAVE IT DELIVERED SATURDAY. 

Here is what FedEx is going to try to do...bare with me and try to follow along...

The luggage is currently on a plane heading to Montana.  

The luggage is due to arrive tonight at the Ramp Facility in Montana which is located at the airport.  

It will then be routed to the BUTTE station...however the BUTTE station does not have Saturday delivery...but there is someone there to receive the luggage but no drivers for that domain.com has to be routed to BUTTE, there is no way around that...

Once it arrives the BUTTE station, it will then be routed to the HELENA station which does indeed have Saturday delivery service...

The HELENA station is a couple hours away...the hope is to have the luggage arrive tomorrow...worst case it will arrive on Monday.

I am calling FedEx at 5:30am tomorrow to get an update.

The case number is: 1220186749

I will keep you posted on any updates I have...so sorry! 

Sabrina
