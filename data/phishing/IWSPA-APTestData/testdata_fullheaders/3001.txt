John -

I'm forwarding an email I sent to Jake last night that you might also be int
erested in seeing.

Also, I had coffee today with Darian Swig, whose family, I'm sure you know, i
s very prominent in San Francisco. Darian is on the national board of Human R
ights Watch, and has quite a bit of international experience and understandi
ng. She'd like to meet with you about how she might be able to help with the
 campaign. You may want to put her on your list for future trips to town - o
r maybe have Dennis Cheng take a meeting with her. She's really terrific.

All best,

Eleni

PS Jake said that advisors would be named after the mid-June announcement an
d sometime after his wedding!

Begin forwarded message:

bout granting TPA when she and her members have serious concerns about TPP. S
he also said that the Republicans are the ones who want it, their constituen
ts are the ones pushing for it, so they should be the ones who vote for it. 
For every one of her members who votes yes, there is a Republican who is off
 the hook. Why should they do that?

r rights/wages and other issues to be included in the deal.

nsion), and that if the Republicans win in 2016, Congress would be handing t
hem TPA too.

 and I took the opportunity to engage him on the issue. He said that at the m
oment Ami Bera was the only democratic member from California who has come o
ut in favor of TPA. Aguilar said he is against it, and raised some of the sa
me concerns as Nancy, and added a few - including that since there is an ope
n door to amend TPP to add members, its possible that this TPA vote could ef
fectively be used to adopt a trade deal with China.

ossibility that the votes are there. NP said that 'having the president pers
onally appeal to members is a very hard thing for them to resist'. Also, Agu
ilar told me that she told members that they should do what is right for the
m, and that it would be a good thing to 'find a way to yes.' (He then added t
hat USTR does not seem to want to make any more concessions to address the c
oncerns he raised, so he doesn't see how they 'get to yes' under those circu
mstances.)

ew other conversations in the last few weeks. My gut is that the same, under
lying, unspoken sentiments that got TPA though the Senate (essentially that t
hese deals are the right thing to do), also exists in the House. The questio
n is, will it be enough?
