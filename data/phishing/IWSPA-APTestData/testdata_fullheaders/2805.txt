....it did my heart good to hear your powerful remarks!  tha
nks for the nice note in my copy of the book.  I am indeed campaigning
 for progress.  it's going well--no poll data yet, but going 3:2 my wa
y at the doors (among unidentified voters) and we're knocking tons of them-
-along with tons of phone call.  Running even in cash on hand--and, as
 you know, red-to-blue!



so--if you could do the contribution we'd talked about ($500 or more) 
around user and heather's event, now would be the time to help us take it o
ver the top!  the web site is judyfeder.com and the address for a chec
k is judy feder for congress, 6818 Tennyson Drive, McLean, Va.  22101.




thanks, John--and we'll all keep up thte good work!  Judy
