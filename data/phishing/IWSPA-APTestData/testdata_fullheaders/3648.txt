SL: OrganizationChair responds to Cruz vetting Carly Fiorina for VP

Following reports<<<link>>> that the Cruz campaign is vetting Carly Fiorina for Vice President, OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement:

"Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers, outsourced American jobs, destroyed HP's stock value and took a $42 million golden parachute upon being fired. If a record like that passes Ted Cruz's vetting operation, it tells you everything you need to know about the Republican Party's misplaced priorities."
