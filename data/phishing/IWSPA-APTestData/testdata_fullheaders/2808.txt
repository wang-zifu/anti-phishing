Hi Amy,

Marketing organizations have traditionally been separated by departments, reporting has been siloed by channel, and data has been channel specific rather than being customer centric. Marketers we speak with consistently tell us that they lack the tools to help them tie engagement and social activity back to what a customer spends.

Times are changing. A multi-channel approach to loyalty now provides marketing departments with a single point with which they can now sufficiently measure retention while instantly being able to look a what channels and content are most effective at propelling people along the path-to-purchase.

Do you have 20 minutes to discuss what a multi-channel loyalty program could do for you and your organization?

Best,
Eric

With a virtually endless number of bright, shiny, and often times, competing options, two areas of focus remain critical for those wanting to optimize the investments they make. At the center of every solid retail growth strategy should be a multi-channel loyalty program and a source of actionable customer, channel, product and purchase data. Want to learn more about how we approach retail loyalty?
