 Campaign Pledge on Ethics Could Become Obstacle to Filling White House Job

President-elect Barack
Obama<<<link>>
bama/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>,
now recruiting for his administration, is trying to fulfill campaign
promises of sweeping ethics restrictions that could deter some potential
appointees.

Vowing to combat the power of "lobbyists who kill good ideas and good plans
with secret meetings and campaign checks," Mr. Obama has laid out more
detailed and more onerous ethics rules than any previous president. He has
pledged to bar appointees from working on matters involving their former
employers for two years, domain.com departing officials from lobbying his
administration for its duration, and require all political appointees to
publicly disclose every meeting with registered lobbyists.

But in a city where policy experts typically work for private interests
between stints in public service =97 and often have spouses or family membe
rs
in the same business =97 such measures could hamper the new administration,
scholars and ethics experts say.

"The problem for Obama is that he will be limiting himself in the expertise
he can tap," said Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor who studies
presidential transitions, noting that President Bill
Clinton<<<link>>
linton/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>faced
a similar difficulty with less sweeping rules.

Some Republicans see a trove of political ammunition in Mr. Obama's promise
s
about public transparency. He has pledged to post online all of his
appointees' employment histories and personal financial disclosures, along
with regular updates of any meetings or conversations they hold with
registered lobbyists.

"If they want to hold themselves to that standard of transparency, then the
y
will be ridiculed continuously, in incessant attacks from the outside," sai
d
David Bossie, an operative who once specialized in unflattering research on
the Clinton White House and now heads the conservative group Citizens
United.

Others are already noting the potential gaps in the rules. Many people in
Washington make money by consulting for private interests seeking to
influence the government but without engaging in the specific activities
that require registration as a lobbyist, thus sidestepping some of Mr.
Obama's restrictions.

"There are so many people who don't have to register that it captures not s
o
many," Ms. Kumar said.

Some of the challenges and potential ambiguities in Mr. Obama's lofty goals
are already apparent in his presidential transition team, which will help
select his administration's senior staff.

Mr. Obama has required everyone advising his transition team to remove
themselves from matters involving a broad spectrum of potential conflicts o
f
interest =97issues in which the adviser has a financial interest, in which
family or business associates have a financial interest, or on which the
person lobbied over the previous year. In cases of an appearance of
conflict, Christopher Lu, the transition team's executive director and a
member of Mr. Obama's Senate staff, must referee.

But John D. user<<<link>>
ple/p/john_d_user/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>,
a former Clinton administration chief of staff and the leader of the
transition team, presents several potential questions.

Mr. user is the chairman of the Center for American Progress, a liberal
research group that solicits private donations and lobbies on a variety of
issues. While he has not personally acted as a registered lobbyist in the
last year, according to the disclosure filings for the center's political
advocacy arm, he had earlier lobbied on issues including the war and
reconstruction in Iraq, Defense Department spending, the treatment of
military detainees, energy issues, bio-fuels and oil prices.

And his brother user is the chairman of a major lobbying firm, the user
Group, which the brothers founded together two decades ago.

In an interview, user user said that he bought his brother out of his
firm in 1996 and that the firm banned lobbying John user while he was in
the government, either in the Clinton White House or the Obama transition.
To comply with the Obama ethics rules, user user said jokingly, "I am
taking my brother out of my will."

Former Senator Tom
Daschle<<<link>>
schle/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>,
a top Obama campaign adviser considered to be a candidate for a prominent
White House job, does not engage in the specific activities that require hi
m
to register as a lobbyist. But he is a highly paid member of the law and
lobbying firm Alston & Bird, where he sells strategic political advice abou
t
a variety of matters that have recently included the financial industry
bailout. And his wife, Linda Daschle, is a registered lobbyist specializing
in defense and aerospace clients. (The Daschles declined to comment.)

David Axelrod<<<link>>
david_axelrod/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>,
Mr. Obama's top campaign strategist and another likely candidate for a domain.com
e
House job, is not a lobbyist either. But he is a partner in a public
advocacy group that has helped corporate clients including the
telecommunications companies AT&T, Cablevision and SBC Communications;
Household Financial, a subprime mortgage lender; Wisconsin Energy, a
coal-fired power company; the nuclear power giant Exelon; and a coalition
that pushes deregulation of the electricity markets.

Still, several Republicans expressed admiration for Mr. Obama's effort. "It
is impressive, very ambitious, with some very laudable objectives =97
minimizing conflicts of interest and self-dealing, slowing the revolving
door, increasing transparency," said Jan Baran, a Republican political law
expert who served on a commission on ethics rules for the first President
Bush.

Joe Gaylord, a Republican consultant and former adviser to Newt
Gingrich<<<link>>
gingrich/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>,
the former House speaker, said: "It could be of value to opposition
researchers. But I guess I would applaud it. It might not be terrific for
the president-elect, but it would be great for America, huh?"

Mr. Clinton set the previous high bar for White House ethics rules, with
mixed results. He required political appointees to pledge that for five
years they would not lobby the government agencies where they had worked,
and that for the rest of their careers they would not lobby on behalf of a
foreign government.

But even those rules were widely criticized as too onerous for many in
Washington. "Much too burdensome," said Paul Light, a public-ethics expert
at New York University<<<link>>
organizations/n/new_york_university/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>.

Whether in response to his appointees' complaints or his own political
timetable, Mr. Clinton rescinded his rules in his last week in office.
