Friends,

With Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropping out of the Republican presidential primary this week, Donald Trump has become the presumptive GOP nominee-meaning we have a lot to discuss.

You all make a tremendous impact spreading our message, so we'd like to host a Talkers Call tomorrow, Thursday May 5 at 10:30AM ET, to discuss the state of the race.

OrganizationCommunications Director User and I will be on the line to offer messaging strategy and to hear your questions and feedback. Please email Jenna Price at user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com> for the dial in.

Thanks,
Mark
