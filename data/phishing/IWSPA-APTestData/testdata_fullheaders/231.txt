our elections >>

The Supreme Court is systematically dismantling our campaign finance 
system brick by brick. Their disastrous decisions in Citizens United and 
McCutcheon opened the floodgates for unlimited dark money in our elections 
-- and the billionaire Koch brothers are taking full advantage.

If you agree our elections shouldn't be up for sale, sign your name to 
demand Congress pass campaign finance reform:

John --

It wasn't long ago that the law restricted the amount of money individuals 
could spend in elections.

But the recent Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon 
made those limits a thing of the past.

No one's more excited than the Koch brothers. They're determined to buy a 
seat in Congress. So far, they've spent over ONE MILLION dollars on ads 
dragging Ann through the mud.

We can't let deep-pocketed billionaires spend their fortunes to buy 
elections. That's why Ann is joining Democrats across the country to 
insist Congress pass significant campaign finance reform.

Click here to stand with Ann and demand that Congress put a stop to money 
as political influence >>

Ann believes that money should not overpower the voices of voters like you 
this November. But without serious action from Congress, we'll never see a 
Koch-free election.

John, will you add your name to force their hand?
