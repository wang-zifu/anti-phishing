Dear Mary, 

Watch the Video [ <<link>> ]. Take Action [ <<link>> ]  [ <<link>> ] 

Coal ash, the secret toxic pollution generated by coal-fired power plants, is poisoning water and threatening communities. Luckily, there is something you can do about it today. Tell your Senators [ <<link>> ] that it's time to look out for our communities, not polluters, and protect our neighborhoods from coal ash! 

This December marks the 4-year anniversary of the disaster that spilled more than a billion gallons of toxic ash in Roane County, Tennessee. This was a devastating wake-up call about our coal ash problem, and nearly half a million people asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect their communities from this toxic waste. 

Unfortunately there are still no federal protections despite compelling evidence that coal ash has leaked or spilled at nearly 200 sites across the country, contaminating nearby streams, rivers, lakes and aquifers with dangerous levels of arsenic, selenium, lead and mercury. Take action today [ <<link>> ] and tell your senators  [ <<link>> ]to protect you from this toxic pollution! 

Congress just doesn't get it. The latest proof is a Senate bill that would domain.com the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from ever setting enforceable federal rules to protect communities from coal ash. Without EPA oversight, this toxic pollution will continue to poison our water and threaten our health. Scientists have found that people who drink water containing arsenic or other heavy metals have an increased risk of cancer, neurological problems, or other diseases. *Please tell your senators* [ <<link>> ] *to stand up for our health and environment!* 

Congress has no business limiting the EPA's ability to protect our communities from this widespread toxic threat. The EPA has a responsibility to protect our drinking water and air from coal ash pollution. Tell your senators [ <<link>> ] to oppose any attempt to delay or weaken EPA efforts to clean up coal ash. 

For clean water, 

Jennifer Peters, National Water Campaigns Coordinator
