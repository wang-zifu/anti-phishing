A few Items

Hello,

The brakes on the range rover sounded terrible last weekend, so I sent it in today to be looked at. It needed new brake pads and rotors, which I went ahead with since it's it can be dangerous to drive around with bad brakes.

In other news, the electricians have been working every day for the past two weeks on repairing the problems with the landscape lighting but keep encountering decayed wiring, burned out transformers and overloaded switches. They are worried that all they are doing will be a continuous problem for the house and is making them look incompetant. 

We've been talking all week about finding workarounds, but today they encountered more issues and they were incredibly frustrated. Rather than have them keep plodding along on something that may be only a temporary solution, I asked them to stop for now and take a minute to step back, talk things over with Marmol and really evaluate what it will take to resolve this matter. Marmol is aware that this project may need to change it's scope a bit and will get back to us with their recommendations. 

Lastly, the new family room rug will be delivered on Monday. 

Melissa
