Clips:
Highlight #1
*McCain: 'If I Were Dictator'* (DMR 09/30/08)
JOHN MCCAIN: *If I were dictator, which I always aspire to be*, I would
write [the bailout bill] very different. [...] People can't reach across th
e
aisle and we give poison speeches [...]. I have obviously been on the phone
with people. I talked with the president this morning and continue to have
conversations with people to move it forward. [...] Let's not point the
finger of blame for a while. There's plenty of time to do that.

Highlight #2
*Local NBC Challenges McCain's Relationship with Republicans* (WHO NBC ME
10/01/08 6:52am)
DAVE PRICE: We asked him if he failed in his efforts to convince other
Republicans to support that bill.

[=85]

JOHN MCCAIN:  Well, first of all you gotta do what's right, and you gotta
get in the arena.  We will have, I believe, still have confidence we will
act because the penalties of inaction are enormous.

PAUL DIX:  Aren't you the party's guy?  Aren't you their leader? Shouldn't
you be the guy to be able to call these folks and say, hey I need you to do
this?

MCCAIN:  I'll leave it to others to give me domain.com for trying to get house
Republicans to the table, I mean it's clear that they were not at the table
before that. And we have a lot to do.

Highlight #3
*Palin Gives No Specifics on McCain's Cap and Trade Position* (CBS 10/01/08
7:10am)
KATIE COURIC: John McCain proposed legislation calling for mandatory caps o
n
global warming gases or CO2 emissions. Do you agree with that?

SARAH PALIN: I support his position on that. Absolutely.

COURIC: But he somewhat backtracked on the campaign trail saying it
wouldn't, they wouldn't, the caps wouldn't be mandatory, they'd be
voluntary. So what do you think? Do you think voluntary caps go far enough?
Or they should be mandatory?

PALIN: He's got a good cap and trade policy that he supports. And details
are being hashed out even right now. But, in principle, absolutely, I
support all that we can do to reduce emissions and to clean up this domain.com.
And John McCain is right on board with that.

COURIC: Voluntary or mandatory in your view?

PALIN: We're gonna keep working on how it can be implemented to actually
make sense and make a difference.

Highlight #4
*ABC Covers Palin's Past Debates* (ABC 10/01/08 7:15am)
KATE SNOW: "It hasn't been the easiest week. The interview mocked,
disastrous reviews of conservatives even.  But go back a couple of years,
and the tapes might surprise you."

SARAH PALIN: "This unfunded liability that we're facing right now is going
to effect every education budget until we get our hands around it."

SNOW:  "That's Sarah Palin tacking Alaska's pension plan shortfall.  In one
of two dozen debates when she ran for governor."

PALIN:  "And inherent in that constitutional amendment, I believe, was the
reference also to benefits."

SNOW:  "From same sex benefits to education, to energy policy, *Palin's
answers were polished, and she had some zingers."*

TOMMY KNOWLES:  "Why should the public trust you to negotiate a gas line?"

PALIN: "user, there you go again.  We discussed this yesterday.  I kinda se
t
you straight yesterday.  We'll do it again today. [...] user, I haven't had
a private jet to be able to bum from my lobbyist friends to zip all over th
e
state and meet and reach every single constituency group that you even."

SNOW: "But even then, opponents questioned her preparedness."

ANDREW HALCRO: "You show up to debates ill-informed, you carry notes with
you, and it's not wrong to carry notes.  You know, nobody's the smartest gu
y
in the room.  But, when the notes consistently say nothing, I think there's
an issue there.  [...] You mad a comment that oil was at $58 a barrel.  I
said it was at 53, in fact, oil is at 53."

PALIN:  "Well, on Sunday I looked it up and oil was 58, Andrew, so I assume
,
and I shouldn't have assumed, huge mistake-"

Highlight #5
*Past Debate Opponent's Comment on Palin* (FNC 10/01/08 7:20am)
BRIAN KILMEADE: "[=85] they went up to Alaska and they talked to her two
opponents, and they said, "What is like debating against Sarah Palin?" Well
,
they said *by the last debate, she totally blew everybody out of the water,
that she had everything cold and she certainly shined.  What really is
frustrating about debating against her, when you try to prove she doesn't
know something, you lose because audiences are enraptured by her, and her
biding comments give you a sense of how competitive she is.*"

Highlight #6
*'Is Anybody Running the McCain Campaign Anymore?' Scarborough Wonders *(MS
NBC
10/01/08 6:08am)
JOE SCARBOROUGH: Is anybody running the McCain campaign anymore? Is it on
autopilot? Did they like, push autopilot [and] went down to 'Disney' for a
month?

MIKE BARNICLE: Mr. Clean. Steve Schmidt.

SCARBOROUGH: You know what, if you're going to take McCain off David
Letterman, why don't you take Palin off of Katie Couric?

[...]

SCARBOROUGH: [The McCain camp tries] to have it both ways. They pick
somebody that is a purely political pick and then they think, 'Oh well we
have to clean her up by letting CBS and ABC [interview her]. No! You don't!

You send her to Hugh Hewitt. You send her to Rush Limbaugh. You send her to
the right and all of us in Manhattan and Georgetown will be angry and say,
'She needs to talk to established media.' No she doesn't! Because *she
can't!* Send her to Limbaugh!

Highlight #7
*McCain Supporters Targeting Pro-Life Latinos in Nevada* (CNN 10/01/08
6:15am)
CHRIS LAWRENCE: [=85] Supporters of Senator John McCain are making a major
push for Hispanic voters here (Nevada), and they're using abortion as the
key issue.  Senator McCain's supporters are aggressively recruiting Nevada'
s
Hispanic voters.  From phone calls to bilingual flyers, they're appealing t
o
voters' faith, and how that reconciles with abortion. [=85]
