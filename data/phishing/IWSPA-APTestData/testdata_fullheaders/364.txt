Two things:

  *   Could DWS potentially do the full hour? We currently have her slated for 30 minutes at 5:30PM EST on 12 May.
  *   What landlines can I give them for this? Would be ideal to do it in studio for highest audio quality possible.

Hi Pablo,

Nice to meet you! We look forward to a great interview with Debbie on May 12th.

The information I will need from you is as follows:

- A contact phone number for the interview (landline is preferred for sound quality but not required)

- A backup phone number

We will be calling her from the studio at the agreed time. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!
