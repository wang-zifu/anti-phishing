I am confident this isn't coming from the staff. I am pretty confident it
is not coming from consultants, but am always nervous about being fully
certain about what they are up to. But "people close to the Clinton's" is a
very wide lot in my view. Reporters who have a story line can almost always
find a "people close to the Clinton's" to give them what they want. More
generally, I do think you are right on this, but very difficult to police.
