RE: Talking Points / Q&A for Monday Meetings

Thanks.  Might be nice if they actually thank the corporate groups (which they seem to be doing for the MPG in those talking points).  Think it is less about the people being tied to offices and the building and more about the acknowledgement that the work they do is valued and valuable.  No???
