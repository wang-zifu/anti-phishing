PHOTO RELEASE: Another Recess Week, Another Set of Protests Telling Kelly Ayotte to Do Her Job
Concord, N.H. -- While the U.S. Senate was in recess for the week, disappointed constituents demonstrated outside of Ayotte's only public recess-week event, as well as at her offices across the state to call on her to do her job and give Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court fair consideration.

See below for pictures from the protests in Keene, Manchester, Portsmouth, and Nashua.
