The Exciting State of Viewability Today: A New Era of Accountability

In 2015 over one trillion display ads were paid for but not seen. These figures are staggering and a clear indicator that something needs to change. Enter viewability. Viewability represents a decided change in accountability for all members of the online advertising ecosystem. Now that advertisers can verify whether their ads are being seen media vendors are rushing to create solutions that increase viewability.

In order to understand the state of viewability today, Quantcast ran experiments from August through October 2015 on more than 100 million impressions across 35 campaigns and six exchanges. This paper will share the findings from these experiments, and cover four steps advertisers can take to incorporate viewability into their campaigns.
