Everything has been fine, except that we missed you and Mary. We went on an
other boat ride with Chuck and Nancy Parrish. Bob Solow joined us. Lots of 
fun. He had a great line on the Greek situation which I will forward to you
 separately. Also had dinner with Skip, his daughter and her fianc=E9e. He 
thinks you're great. Today-dominos. We won't be calling you for the rules.

Happy to meet with Terisita. I'm back in the office next week. OK to give h
er my contact info.

How are you doing?
