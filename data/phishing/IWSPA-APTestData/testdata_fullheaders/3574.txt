John --

There's a lot going on right now, but we can't lose track of
this: As of today, Congress has just six scheduled days of
work to avoid another government shutdown.

It's deja vu -- just like they did in 2013, extreme voices in
Congress are taking pet political issues that have nothing
to do with funding our government and using them to
manufacture a crisis.

If they refuse to do their jobs, it'll affect millions of
Americans. It's simply beyond irresponsible.

And let's be clear: It's Congress' job to pass a budget.
Putting together a budget isn't the time to play political
games to try and take health care away from millions,
restrict women's health care options, or block efforts to cut
back on carbon pollution.

They've done it before, and it cost us $24 billion -- an
unnecessary and very real expense, and one that doesn't
even begin to describe the damage done to people's lives by
deferred paychecks and the loss of services that businesses
and working families depend on.

There's still time for Congress to come together to pass a
smart budget. But if Congressional leaders choose politics
over people, we'll be headed toward a shutdown soon. It's
going to be up to OFA supporters to fight back, just like we
did to end the shutdown in 2013. Like President Obama said:

"We've fought back because of you. We shouldn't slip back
because of Congress. I urge them to send me a budget that
invests in our future."

Stay tuned -- we'll keep you up-to-date on the latest.

Thanks,

Abby
