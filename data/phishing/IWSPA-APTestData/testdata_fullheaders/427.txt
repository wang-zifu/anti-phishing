Really few things to add.Very unlucky situation:- domain.com connection not available as requested (so no way to show TNI, Skype, Facebook, GMail, etc.)- RCS system completely gone crazy (I spoke with Alberto O. by phone for at least 1 hour, but no way to understand what caused the problem and no way to solve it remotely)2 "good points" - in my opinion - regarding the unlucky situation:1. The customer has been updated that the main issue was the domain.com connection not available (so not our fault);2. The technical demo did not start at all. So no "product internal issues" appeared to the customer, but simply... "we've to meet again".Last thing: "fortunately" it happened on the last demo and not on the first one (now my demo chain is no more operating correctly).Alessandro--Alessandro ScarafileField Application EngineerSent from my mobile.

Hello team. The meeting with Dany was not successful.  Bret assured that the domain.com connection was the same as last domain.com. unfortunately it was not. I will let Alessandro explain the technical issues encountered. I was able to give the presentation and answer questions. They are still very interested and would like to organize another meeting ASAP at a local hotel.  I have Aldo proposed a private meeting at ISS. MARCO can we send them tickets?As for NYPD I'm canceling the meeting. I have had no reply from emails and calls. I don't know what office to meet them at.  I'm very disappointed with my contact there. Alex VelascoKey Account ManagerHacking TeamMilan Singapore Washington DCwww.Organization.comemail: user@domain.com: +1 301.332.5654phone: +1 443.949.7470
