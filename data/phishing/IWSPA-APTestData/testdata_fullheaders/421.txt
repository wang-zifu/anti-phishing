I did more testing with your patch on top of today's CVS, but the patch
didn't help at all.
The following is the results of the tests:

Testing setup:
1. created a "/dev/md0" with 4 scsi disks
2. created a LVM Volume group "vg" with the "/dev/md0"
3. created a LVM logical volume "vol1" with "vg"
4. created a XFS fs with a command:
    mkfs.xfs -f -d domain.com=8,swidth=8 /dev/vg/vol1
    -----------meta-data=/dev/vg/vol1           isize=256    agcount=8,
agsize=32767 blks
    -----------data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=262136,
imaxpct=25
    -----------         =                       domain.com=1      swidth=1 blks,
unwritten=0
    -----------naming   =version 2              bsize=4096
    -----------log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=1200,
version=1
    -----------         =                       domain.com=1 blks
    -----------realtime =none                   extsz=65536  blocks=0,
rtextents=0

Test results:
1. mount with quota enabled => occasional kernel oops, attached the file
oops1
2. mount without quota enabled => occasional kernel oops, attached the file
oops2
3. mount without quota enabled, while md device is in degraded mode =>
always kernel oops, attached the file oops3

Thanks,

JLee
