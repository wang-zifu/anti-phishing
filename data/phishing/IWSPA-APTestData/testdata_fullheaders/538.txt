First segment all about U.S. killing Taliban leader Mansour and plane stuff.

Only flag is Sully saying whatever happened, it didn't immediately destroy the plane (seems to throw cold water on bomb theory).

Second segment: Bernie

Thinks he can win a majority of remaining states
Over 400 superdelegates declared for Hillary Clinton before the race. I think we have a chance to win over superdelegates
If we do very well in next 6 states, we will have a majority of pledged delegates, or come very close to it.

Dickerson: Need to win each state by a 40-pt margin...

Bernie: Steep hill, but we've won races by more than 40 points. California very progressive state.
3% at beginning of the race

Taken on entire establishment this campaign
Hopes Organizationwill hold Hillary to her word to participate in California debate

Dickerson: target on DWS?

Bernie: No. Personally I like her. She's not the chair the Organizationneeds right now. Needs to bring working people back into the fold. What the Democratic Party is about is running around to rich people's homes and raising absurd amounts of money. We need to bring working people into the fold.

Going to take fight all the way to the convention. Wants to change superdelegates, open primaries, etc.
