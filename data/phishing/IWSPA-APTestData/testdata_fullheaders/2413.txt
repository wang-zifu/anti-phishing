FROM JENNIFER

Deborah wishes for something different. A true Oaklander, Deborah has
lived in her home for more than 20 years. In this home, her children
have grown into adults, and now her children have children of their
own.

But there's been a shift in the neighborhood. She's fearful more than
ever before. She sees people struggling, hears stories of neighbors
that cannot maintain their home and, worst of all, she fears for her
family's safety. Her car is in the repair shop because there were
bullet marks left behind after a shooting on her street. Her
grandkids were on the porch that day and she can't imagine what could
have happened.  Sadly, this isn't the first time. There have been
three shootings within the last several months in her neighborhood
and she wants it to stop.

Listening to Deborah that day reminded me of Raymen Justice. A bright
17 year old, Raymen had transferred to Life Academy from Oakland High
and his favorite subjects were math, science and English. His life
was tragically taken away on Tuesday September 21st as he walking on
the street. At his funeral earlier this month, I was saddened to see
and hear the grieving community and was incredibly frustrated for the
violence on our street. My deepest condolences go out to his family
and friends.

This past week I was asked by a high school student, "What will you
do to keep guns out of Oakland and out of the hands of young people?"
It was a poignant question and one that no teenager should ever have
to ask. As community leaders, parents, and government officials it is
our duty to protect the lives of our youth and provide a nurturing
safe environment.

If elected I will work day and night to invest in the safety and
future of our youth. We need better policies and enforcement to
eliminate violence on our streets. I will not let Oakland fall apart
at the cost of our young people. We must invest in the economy, we
must invest in education, we must invest in our community so our
youth of tomorrow have a safe future.

Join me and invest in the future of Oakland.
