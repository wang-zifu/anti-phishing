Dear 
Amy,

Komen LA County is proud to announce that we have launched a new video campaign to communicate the importance of early detection. We are proud to introduce the first-ever Singing Mammogram in advance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.Similar to the idea of a singing telegram, this smile-inducing video features a catchy, lyrical song that delivers an important health message: early detection saves lives. Screening tests can find breast cancer early, when the chances of survival are highest.  The goal of the Singing Mammogram is to bring an element of levity to an otherwise serious issue, with the hope that this will inspire more people to share this important message. We are asking for your help to get the word out by sharing the video with your friends and family via social media during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Influencing just one person-in-need could potentially save a life.

Please take a moment to view the video.  If you like it, please consider donating a social media post by signing up for our Thunderclap Campaign.You can also share the video directly by copying/pasting the following suggested text to your twitter or facebook page: #BreastCancer affects 1 in 8 women in the US. Share the #SingingMammogram & influence women you love to get an exam! <<link>> you so much for your help in sharing this video.
