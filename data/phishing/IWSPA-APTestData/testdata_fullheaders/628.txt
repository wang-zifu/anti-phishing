  Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of
  information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of
  DivX video.

  3. Mad Phat Crazy Skins




  Sell DivX Pro From Your Web Site
  -------------------------------

  DivX has become the world's most popular video technology and
  garnered millions of loyal fans thanks almost entirely to
  word-of-mouth buzz from users like you. We've always known that
  DivX users are the generous sort--the kind of people who want to
  share great-looking video technology with the rest of the world.
  But what if you could exercise your generous nature by spreading
  the DivX gospel while making money at the same time?



  Now you can. The DivX Affiliate Program allows web site owners to
  make money while providing users with the best video technology on
  the domain.com. If you have your own web site, all you have to do is
  sign up to become an authorized DivX Pro Affiliate. Once you're
  approved, you simply add a DivX download link to your Web site
  and, voila, you're in business. Every time someone clicks on your
  link to domain.com and purchases DivX Pro, you'll earn a percentage
  of the sale.

  Japanese Crime Noir in DivX Video
  ---------------------------------

  A wide variety of innovative studios and film distributors have
  been using DivX video-on-demand technology to sell downloadable
  DivX titles online since August of last year. One of the many
  interesting films currently available is the Japanese crime
  thriller "Nobody" from DivX partner Vanguard Cinema. Called "a
  triumph" by the New York Times, "Nobody" is an action-packed
  thriller-noir that tells a story of an escalating cycle of
  violence and revenge. In the tradition of international crime
  thrillers like "La Femme Nikita" and "Tokyo Fist," "Nobody" takes
  the viewer through a labyrinth of suspense and carnage without
  release until the very end.
