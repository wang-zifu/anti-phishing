*In "womens event" McCain misrepresents himself, record on equal Pay  *

JOHN MCCAIN: "We haven't done enough. We have not done enough. And I'm
committed to making sure that there's equal pay for equal work. That there
is equal opportunity in every aspect of our society. And that is my record
and you can count on it."

*McCain to woman in wheelchair: Program to support disabled Americans is not
the "right kind of legislation" *
QUESTIONER (in wheelchair): "Senator McCain, [...] my friends and I=97we are
members of a group called ADAPT. We were in Washington in April. And 40
people with disabilities were arrested. We came to your office to ask you to
support our national legislation, the Community Choice Act. What that would
do is it would end the institutional bias and allow people with disabilities
to choose where we would live and would receive services. [...] We come from
all over the country [...] Will you sign on to support the Community Choice
Act?

JOHN MCCAIN: "I will not because I don't think that it's the right kind of
legislation. [...] The Community Choice Act is not a piece of the
legislation that I support [...]"

*McCain on Social Security: "It's an absolute disgrace."*

QUESTIONER: "[...] Many of the proposals that are being created for people
of my generation no longer include Social Security because of the belief it
will not be there. Tell me how you plan to fix it."

JOHN MCCAIN: "Thank you very much. *I'd like to start out by giving you a
little straight talk. Under the present setup, because we've mortgaged our
children's futures, you will not have Social Security benefits that
present-day retirees have unless we fix it. And Americans have got to
understand that. Americans have got to understand that we are paying
present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today.
And that's a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace, and it's gotta be fixed*."

MCCAIN: "Now how do you fix it? [...] You fix it by reaching across the
aisle and you say to the Democrats: sit down with me at the table. Sit down
with me the way Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did the last time that Social
Security was in deep trouble. And that was way back in 1983. Ronald Reagan,
conservative President from California, and Tip O'Neil, the liberal Democrat
from Massachusetts, sat down together and they walked out of the White House
together and they say, we're gonna fix Social Security. And they did for
about 20, 30 years. Right, Hank? Hank and I were part of the Congress at the
time. And we were proud. We were proud to see the kind of bipartisanship
that was exhibited for future generations.

MCCAIN: "Well now it's broken again. [...] Nothing is forever in American. I
want to promise you, that I'll say to the Democrats and I'll say to the
American people, here's a chart, here's a chart, here's how much is coming
in, here's how much is going out, and here's where there's more money going
out than coming in, and here's where there's no money left. Now are we going
to hand it off to your generation to fix it, or are we gonna do the hard
things? I wanna be President to do the hard things. [...] It's gonna change
and it's got to change. And I will change it."

*McCain referring to young blond woman, tells college student, "you have
very attractive friends"*
JOHN MCCAIN: "Do you have any passion?"

STUDENT: "Senator, [...] college students are graduating with an
unprecedented rate of debt [...]. What do you plan to do to alleviate these
student loans and reduce the cost of school?"

JOHN MCCAIN: "Thank you. [turning to blond girl sitting next to student
asking question] Is this, [...] You're the photographer here, is that--?"

FRIEND: [inaudible]

*MCCAIN: "Oh the paparazzi for this rock star, I see." [points to blond
woman next to her] I see. Thank you. Skylar, thank you; you have very
attractive friends."*

*McCain gets into tense exchange with Vietnam Vet; falsely claims he has a
perfect voting record from "all =85 veterans service organizations"*
JOHN MCCAIN: "I see a person with a funny hat on that says Vietnam Veterans,
so I'd love to recognize you first, sir."
[...]
QUESTIONER: "Senator, veterans and all Americans admire your service [...]
but we know that you voted against=97well, actually you didn't vote on the G
I
bill and you spoke out against it. We understand you have a difference on
that but we [...] haven't heard an explanation of why you voted against your
colleagues' proposals to increase health care funding in 2004, [2005],
[2006] and [2007] when we had troops coming back from two wars."

MCCAIN: "[...] I have great respect for Sen. Webb and I appreciate his
efforts. [...] The problem that some of us had [...] was that there were
studies that showed that we didn't have incentives for people to become
career military people. [...]"

MCCAIN: "With that all I can say is, I don't know what you're pointing to
but I've received every award from every major veterans' organization in
America=97I've received every organization in America their awards=97but sir
 I
don't know what you're referring to [...] But the reason *why I have a
perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
the American Legion and all the other veterans service organizations is
because of my support of them*. But you can go ahead and respond if you want
to. Go ahead."

QUESTIONER: "*You do not have a perfect voting record by the DAB and the
VFW; that's where these votes are recorded*. And the votes were proposals
[...] by your colleagues in the Senate to increase health care funding of
the VA in 2003, [2004], [2005] and [2006] for troops returning from Iraq and
Afghanistan. And you voted against those proposals. I can give specific
Senate votes, the numbers of those Senate votes right now."

*McCain on FISA: Telecommunications companies "should not be held
responsible in the way that they're to be sued"*
JOHN MCCAIN: "On FISA, I believe it's very dangerous [...] to hold the
telecommunications corporations liable for them acting in cooperation with
the govnernment after 9/11 to help us monitor the communications of Al-Qaeda
and terrorists. [...] *I believe the telecommunications company, or any
other organization, when called upon by their government, to do something
that is in the national security interest, that they should not be held
responsible in the way that [...] they're to be sued*."

MCCAIN: "[...] Now it's my view that we should have the ability, with
certain court procedures observed, to monitor the
communications=97particularly with the dramatic modernization and ability of
communicate [sic] between organizations that want to do America harm. And
so, I'm glad you're recording this because I'd like to make sure you show it
to all your friends. Have no doubt where I stand: that the
telecommunications companies should not be held liable for cooperation they
provided the government of the United States after 9/11, when we were trying
to stop further attacks on the United States of America. And to say that you
want them to be held liable is something in my view that would be a trial
lawyer's dream. And I strongly oppose it. Sen. Obama supports it. That's the
difference in our views."

*McCain on education: Thankful we had "the money to send =85 our kids to
Catholic school"
*QUESTIONER: "I've been a teacher for about 31 years. What is your feeling
about No Child Left Behind?"

JOHN MCCAIN: "Thank you. By the way, *did I mention that Cindy was a teacher
of special education before I took her out of that honest line of work*?

MCCAIN: "[...] I think No Child Left Behind needs to be fixed. However, I
think it was a right beginning. I think we need to be able to judge [...]
students' performance all over America. [...] But now [...] we need to go
back and sit down together again Republican and Democrat and fix what needs
to be fixed.

MCCAIN: "And [...] some of what needs to be fixed is more full funding for
some of the programs that were never adequately funded, as you know.
Including special education. Including this terrible problem that you're
very aware of in this rise in autism amongst children in America. It's a
terrible thing that's happening. And it's going to require additional
educational capabilities.

MCCAIN: "So I want to fix it but I also have to give you a little more
straight talk. I'm for choice and competition. *Now Cindy and I had the
money to send=97the ability to send our kids to Catholic school. I want ever
y
American to be able to send their child to the school of their choice.
*
MCCAIN: "[...] Charter schools work. Charter schools are good competition.
Some of them don't work. Some of them don't work, so they should fail. But
if you look at New York City today and if you look at New Orleans [...] New
York City's education has improved rather dramatically. And also, New
Orleans because they had to start from Square One because of the tragedy of
Katrina; they know have 30 charter schools there. And the quality of
education is improving.

MCCAIN: "Learn the lessons of No Child Left Behind. Fix the problem. Reward
good teachers. Find bad teachers another line of work. Fix education, which
is the future of America."

*McCain tells woman who's parents died of cancer "Nuclear power is safe... a
vital part of our nation's energy future"*
JOHN MCCAIN: "I did see a person over here with a 'no nukes' sign so maybe
we can't start with you. Because obviously you know I am a supporter of
nuclear power. [...]"

QUESTIONER: "[...] I live here in Portsmouth. And my father also worked in
the Piketon plant and he also died young of cancer. He had 4 cancers. My
mother died of cancer as well. And I feel strongly about getting the Piketon
plant cleaned up and bringing alternative energy industry into Portsmouth
[...] We've done this for 50 years. We deserve better. We don't want our
young people to continue to have to work in a highly toxic industry. And I
believe that a lot of people here probably feel the same way and are afraid
to say anything. Because I know the outcome in my personal life has been
very detrimental to me in fighting this nuclear industry."

MCCAIN: "I know I speak on behalf of all of us [...] and extend our sympathy
at the loss of your parents. There's no way that I can provide proper
consolation except to say to you that I believe that nuclear power is and
can be safe. [...] We have sailed Navy ships around the world for more than
60 years with nuclear power plants on them. There has never been any
recorded case that I know of that someone was either injured or killed or
had any effects of, of those nuclear power plants. I know that there's been
Three Mile Island. And we know about Chernoble. But I do believe that
nuclear power is safe. [...] But the evidence that I have that I'd like to
share with you, is that nuclear power is safe. And it is, I think, a vital
part of our nation's energy future[...]

QUESTIONER: "One of the things that I've been striving for is to make sure
that workers that go into the Piketon site are protected, and I haven't been
able to get that affirmation from the NRC or the EPA or any of the DOE or
any of the groups that are in charge of that cleanup and that site. And I
think that's one of the things that many people are concerned about here.

MCCAIN: "Well I will (1) try to get that information from you, (2) myself
try to contact the nuclear regulatory [...] commission and any other
oversight organization and get the information [...] I promise you I will
learn, and I will read the information that you send me, and I will act on
it as I think would be appropriate."

*McCain gives crying woman losing her job "some straight talk," doubts he'll
be able to help keep her job*
QUESTIONER: "[...] I'm the founder of a small, non-domain.com hospice in
Wilmington, Ohio. [...] I'm sure you are aware that DHL is closing that
airpark in Wilmington. We will lose 8,600 jobs. [starts to cry] Will you
call for Senate hearings to investigate the DHL-UPS joint venture, which
could be an antitrust issue? [...] We're just small people trying to live a
life. And I want to be able to keep our nonprofits alive. Thank you."

JOHN MCCAIN: "I have been briefed, and I know about this situation. [...]
This is a terrible blow. Um, if there's an anitrust implication that's
associated with this, I certainly would seek a thorough investigation [...]
*We are in a period of transition to a global economy. That is of no
consolation to anyone who is losing their job. *[...] But we have to offer
them an opportunity to get the education and re-training programs so they
can re-enter the job market.

MCCAIN: "[...] *I've got to look you in the eye and give you some straight
talk; I don't know if I can stop it or not. Or if it will be stopped it.
[...] In fact, some more straight talk: I doubt it. Ok? But I am for a
thorough examination of this situation.* [...]

MCCAIN: "In the meantime, there are manufacturing jobs that have been lost
all over the state of Ohio, and it's been a terrible trauma and we have got
to give people another opportunity. And you do that by going to the
community colleges and saying: design education and training programs that
are designed for the local job market and implement those programs. The
private programs today do not work. They are total failures.

MCCAIN: "[...] But I also want to make a commitment [...] if someone has a
high-paying job, particularly an older worker, and that worker has to take a
low-paying job just to survive [...] that we would subsidize, with some of
this job training money that's being wasted, that worker's salary [...]
while they're undergoing their re-training and education programs.

MCCAIN: "[...] I believe in free trade; I believe that it's important to the
economy."

*McCain Predicts War With Iran, Calls 16-Year-Old Boy "Attractive"*
QUESTIONER: "Senator McCain, how can world leaders take the President of
Iran seriously with his outrageous claims to wipe Israel off the face of the
earth? And, as a follow-up question, would you consider a 16-year-old
running mate?"

JOHN MCCAIN: "If that individual happens to be as *attractive and articulate
* as you are, I certainly would=97consider it. Thank you.

MCCAIN: "Um, I'm worried that the President of Iran, Ahmadinejad's comments
are not just crazy talk. [...] We all know that they just tested uh, uh a
missile. Uh, which,by the way, was done by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
Which is a terrorist organization that supports terrorists and in my view--
We had a vote on the floor of the Senate to label the same organization as a
terrorist organization.

MCCAIN: "[...] If there is a outbreak of conflict [...] with Iran and
Israel, or because of Iran's continued aggressive behavior-- [...] *If
there's an outbreak of conflict, then I worry very much that the United
States will be drawn into it*. [...] And I worry about brave young Americans
who are serving in the military today."

MCCAIN: "[...] By the way, if there's anyone concerned about the fact that
we don't have communications with Iran, we have plenty of communications
with them."
