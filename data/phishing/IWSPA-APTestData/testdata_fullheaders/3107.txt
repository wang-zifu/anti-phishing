Steve,

Our teams are working towards a meeting in early January to pursue a larger more meaningful partnership as it relates to the Wheel of Fortune franchise.  At times, in the past, you and I have discussed the possibility of something more substantial involving GSN and IGT.....I thought it might be worthwhile to have that discussion again...and in a more substantive manner if your interest remains.  I can be available for a trip to LA the afternoon/evening of Tuesday January 7th or first thing the morning of Wednesday January 8th if either domain.com your calendar.  Alternately, if you will be in Vegas for CES we could possibly chat over coffee....at your convenience.  

let me know if this is suitable to you.....

and have a HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!
