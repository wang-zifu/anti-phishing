I have no objections.  If no one else does, I'll tell Kate to designate
Christine as the interim contact.

One key component of the final package on domain.com nominees is the final
FBI report.  The FBI is asking Kate Shaw who within the Transition Team
should be designated to receive such reports (they need to have TS/SCI
clearance).  I think once we have identified the WH Counsel it makes
sense for him/her to be designated, but in the interim it should be me.
If you agree Chris, please tell Kate to notify the FBI. Thanks all -
there is some urgency as the FBI will expedite the clearance for the
designated individual.
