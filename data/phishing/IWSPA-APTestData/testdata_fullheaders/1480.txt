-- Coverage of WJC and G.W. Bush=E2=80=99s friendship and joint interview w
ith TIME
Magazine about how they will handle the 2015 election which may likely pit
HRC against Jeb Bush. Says WJC said he tries not to talk about the race
unless he=E2=80=99s at home and HRC asks. G.W. Bush says he can=E2=80=99t s
ay who=E2=80=99s going
to win but there=E2=80=99s going to be flash in the pans, crisis, funding, 
and all
kinds of other things, and eventually the person who is best for their
party will be nominated. Cornell Belcher and Michael Duffy join to comment
on the fact that this is a very anti-establishment moment yet the two most
establishment figures are appearing together. Duffy says the Clinton
political theory is the divisiveness is unpleasant and people don=E2=80=99t
 like
it, but they often reward it if you=E2=80=99re willing to walk towards it, 
and the
Clintons are not afraid of it. Says the Bushes and Clintons are centrists.
Heidi Przybyla says she doesn=E2=80=99t think people believe it. Chris Matt
hews
says WJC told TIME that HRC once told him that she would never run for
office because she is too aggressive and people would never vote for her.
Belcher says politics now rewards aggressiveness. Przybyla says HRC is
absolutely right and it=E2=80=99s not as easy for a woman to be rewarded fo
r being
aggressive. Says things haven=E2=80=99t changed because HRC=E2=80=99s whole
 approach this
time around has been to soften up and focus on being a grandmother and talk
about her relationship with her mother but she=E2=80=99ll have many surroga
tes
doing that aggressiveness for her. Duffy says some of the attacks on HRC
will be on WJC and Przybyla counters and says WJC is still one of the most
popular politicians in American politics and she can see him being used as
a surrogate. Hardball with Chris Matthews

-- Commentary on Quinnipiac poll says voters do not trust HRC and shows her
trailing Bush, Walker, and Rubio. Ed Henry joins the show and says the
campaign is not worried and they think HRC is winning comfortably in other
polls against Republicans. Says we need to be skeptical because in April
Quinnipiac did a similar poll which showed similarly poor honesty and
trustworthiness ratings but in that poll she was beating Republicans with
no problem and now she=E2=80=99s not beating them. Says what we didn=E2=80
=99t see in the
poll is that Bernie Sanders is doing as well or better than HRC against
those Republicans in the key battleground states. This shows he=E2=80=99s g
etting
the enthusiasm where she is not. Henry says Clinton camp says they are more
nervous about John Kasich than any other Republican because he=E2=80=99s cu
t taxes
and has the Midwestern values so he=E2=80=99s a little bit of a loose canno
n. Says
John user and other officials are a little more concerned about Kasich,
especially if he can carry Ohio. The O=E2=80=99Reilly Factor

-- Coverage of HRC saying Planned Parenthood is under a concerted attack.
Al Sharpton says two videos released claim to show PP executives selling
fetal body parts. Sharpton says this is not true and the New York Times
writes that the videos were edited to eliminate statements explaining that
Planned Parenthood does not domain.com from tissue donation, which requires the
clear consent of the patient and the videos are a dishonest attempt to make
legal, voluntary and potentially lifesaving tissue donations appear
nefarious and illegal. Says that for Republicans the videos are another
excuse to go after PP and the women it helps. Shows clip of HRC saying it
=E2=80=99s
unfortunate that PP has been the object of such a concerted attack. Laura
Bassett says it=E2=80=99s incredibly significant that a democratic presiden
tial
candidate was willing to come forward since democrats have been hesitant to
say anything especially because there has been a congressional
investigation and a lot of the facts haven=E2=80=99t come in yet and suppos
edly
more videos are coming out, but HRC is sticking her neck out and saying PP
does a lot of good things for women that have nothing to do with abortions.

Americans are still vulnerable to audits based on their personal beliefs. T

Bruce weighs in saying HRC wants to be the third term of Obama, but we are
seeing especially with the Planned Parenthood situation, what the
Democratic Party has become and this is going to affect people=E2=80=99s de

Host says issues of trust and honesty are the issues that are dogging HRC
and if she doesn=E2=80=99t find a way to break with her own party on this, 
she=E2=80=99s
going to be in trouble. Charlie Kirk says the Clintons believe that if
anyone disagrees with you, you start to weaponize institutions you belong
