						Dear readers,




The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't
touch the passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week,
Apple devotees gathered in New York to find out what their guru,
Steve Jobs, has in store for them. They were not disappointed,
with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which continue to push
the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with
Windows. Read the 
full coverage from 
CNET's domain.com.

PIMs on the side

Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
   PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
   Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
   this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
   cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

Apple eMac not just for education anymore

Ideally suited to students living in small spaces and home
   users with basic needs, the eMac is an attractive, adequately
   speedy, and easy-to-use PC without the flat-panel iMac's
   relatively high price. Wondering whether to go CRT or
   flat-panel? Read our review.

 Readers mourn Gene Kan




Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and
the PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.

--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends



1

Gene Kan:

   Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
   29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
   community. Last week, search requests for information on
   25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
   products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
   peer-to-peer space, many domain.com him with legitimizing file
   sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
   News.

2

Macworld:

   The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
   good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
   announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
   few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
   which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
   quagmire.



3

PayPal:



   It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
   PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
   for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a domain.com claiming that
   PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
   subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its
   involvement with online gambling transactions.



4

Wi-Fi:

   I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
   on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
   interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
   including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
   build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
   where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
   airports.

5

eMac:

   This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
   wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
   review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
   used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
   computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
   processing and accessing the Web.
