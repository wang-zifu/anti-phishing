John:

Talked to Eryn and know you were out on Friday.  Let me just give you the
key elements coming out of the Paulson Institute clean energy finance
seminar in China, for ease of reference.

Bottom-line:  Chinese were engaged, focused, and positive about the suite
of ideas for clean energy finance.  I briefed both sets of USG activities
aimed at overcoming the first/tech development valley of death (grants,
ARPA-E, hubs, EFRCs, etc.) as well as US-Chinese cooperation in that space
through CERC and the second/commercialization valley of death (loan program
leading to first grid-scale deployment of PV, CSP, largest wind farm,
etc.).  MacWilliams did a great job explaining current programs and
successes achieved.

Ma Jun, of the People's Bank of China, laid out an ambitious agenda of
tools to use to promote clean energy finance, including ideas such as green
bank, policy support (e.g., green bonds), infrastructure support (e.g., by
lowering cost of capital), and legal reform (e.g., consumer protections,
enforcing environmental laws by holding banks accountable for climate
effects of projects they finance).  Discussion embraced state-owned
enterprises, private enterprise, and public private partnerships.  The
Chinese Investment Corp was also represented.

Sandalow came up with the idea of advancing these ideas via a Track 1-1/2
dialogue, and when we can speak I can flesh that out a bit.  But that is
the thumbnail of the results and, as I said, Hank wanted to be sure you get
a quick download.  Thanks again for your guidance and support.

BTW had a message from Melanie Hart from CAP about China, and will close
the loop with her as well.

Best,

Dan
