Dear Steven,
For sure Frozen is having an outstanding word of mouth and this can have an impact on our numbers.

The peculiarity of the Italian Christmas corridor and the school holidays are the main reason to be optimistic today.
In essence every day could work well until Jan 7 (schools will open again that day).

Having said that, considering our first week end estimates, we could foresee a lifetime BO of €4.5ml.

I'm at your disposal for any further information you may need.
Best regards

Nicola
