Subject: Zac... Messaging for Next Week

Spoke to Zac and told him about our messages of the week, infrastructure (M
on, Tues, Weds) and guns (Thurs, Fri).

He is more focused on getting state parties and Members of Congress to hit 
Trump on his tax returns =96 statements, events, etc.

Zac is less interested in a policy issue like roads and bridges, where Trum
p is actually pretty good (Trump has said our airports look like crap compa
red to Dubai, for example).

I told him we could focus on infrastructure and guns in the states and cont
inue to go after tax returns with national press. He wasn=92t completely so
ld. Told him I=92d huddle with our team and circle back with him.

Thoughts?
