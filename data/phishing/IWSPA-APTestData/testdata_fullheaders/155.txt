Dejuana,

The Factivist post was a press release that we had sent out last night. I was going to use my boss, User, for the quote but he suggested that Virgie may be a better choice given she is the Chair of the Black Caucus. He also felt she would appreciate the gesture as I am sure that she did.

The Communications Department often works under tight deadline constraints so some decisions must be made quickly. My decision to call Virgie directly should not be perceived as a slight or something done in poor taste. It was done out of the urgency of the request.

Going forward, I will keep you informed as to any of my discussions with Virgie and I will loop other CE Directors in conversations that are relevant to their issue area.

Also, if you need to reach me immediately feel free to text me on my cell which is (703) 625-7700. As you see, I am rather accessible.

Best,
Deshundra
