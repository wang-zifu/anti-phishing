This is the second time in two weeks the Grand Oil Party has obstructed the
 bill to raise the liability caps for oil companies like BP from $75 millio
n to $10 billion to help ensure that they pay every cent of economic and en
vironmental disasters caused by their negligence.

Senate Republicans' message to America's taxpayers is clear: "Hasn't oil gi
ant BP suffered enough for the environmental catastrophe their negligence c
aused?"

Dear Friend,

rBalls>Gulf Coast states need to fight back!

Today Sen. Harry Reid stated on the Senate floor: "We have to put our foot 
down and make clear that taxpayers will not pick up the tab.  I will do eve
rything in my power to make sure the polluters pay the price."

When the Democrats brought forward the "Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act" to 
make British Petroleum pay for this environmental disaster, Sen. James Inho
fe single-handedly blocked the bill on behalf of the Grand Oil Party. This 
is a man who hates the idea of protecting the environment. Despite the over
whelming scientific evidence he believes global climate change is a myth. A
nd now he's protecting big oil company profits, over the environment, local
 economies and the American taxpayers. It's no wonder that over $1.2 millio
n in big oil money has gushed into the Senator's campaign coffers over the 
years.

According to the Associated Press, over the weekend, large balls of tar was
hed up on the beach at Port Fourchon, Louisiana, some of them 8 inches acro
ss. And just this morning, more tar balls reportedly washed up in the Flori
da Keys. Every coastal area is at risk.

Can you stop by an effected coastal area and help with the clean up?<http:/
/www.americansunitedforchange.org/page/s/TarBalls>

Let's send Senator Inhofe a message that sticks. Lets show him that this di
saster is real. Can you take a picture of a tar ball on the beach and send 
it to Senator Inhofe's office so that he can see that the disaster is real?
 If you're not near an ocean you can send Senator Inhofe a virtual tarball,
 images of globs of oil being found on the ocean floor today.<<<link>>

This is a typical move from Republicans, beholden to big business, unconcer
ned for the average American. It's a simple concept, when you cause a probl
em, you take responsibility.

For some reason, Big Oil and Republicans in the Senate don't think that the
 people who caused this disaster should have to pay to clean it up. How doe
s that make any sense? It's not fair to Americans and not fair to the Gulf 
Coast to waste any time or burden anyone else.

Don't let big oil wash their hands of this disaster, the Senate needs to pa
ss the "Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act." Send a tar ball to Sen. James Inho
fe! Let him know we mean business <<<link>>
page/s/TarBalls>

We can't stand by and let science deniers and reckless oil companies take a
dvantage of us.

Thanks,

Jeremy
