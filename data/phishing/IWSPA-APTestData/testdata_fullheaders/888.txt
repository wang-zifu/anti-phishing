As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a startling revelation that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!

Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - domain.com defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
Things that make you go hmmmm...

See You in August,              Randy Nieland

SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind

<<link>>

During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.

SQL Server Cumulative Patch

<<link>>

A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clark

<<link>>,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html

Most Windows 2015 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Sorting IP Addresses Via Script

<<link>>

Documentation is everything. If you have a handle on your 
network configuration, it's much easier to manage. IP 
addresses are one bit of information that must be properly 
tracked, but often it's a manual effort to enter and sort 
data. Using the script techniques provided in this brief 
article, you can convert an address to a 32-bit number, 
perform the sort, then convert back to the standard dotted 
decimal format. An Excel sample spreadsheet is also provided 
to get you started.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown

<<link>>

Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be 
tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be 
careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a 
stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I 
don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few 
different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping 
around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets 
curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?

Virtual Sketching
Discovered by Diana

<<link>>~vze2mfh8/

I believe I still have an old Etch-A-Sketch in a box 
somewhere. Maybe I should dig it back out and webify the 
thing just for grins. Check out this example of novelty web 
programming, assuming y'all don't kill the site. If it's 
down, check back later. Using a web form, you can enter the 
moves you'd like to see represented on the pad, which is 
viewed through a live webcam. I'd love to see someone craft 
the Lockergnome logo. Impress me...
