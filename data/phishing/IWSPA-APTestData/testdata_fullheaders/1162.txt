To get us all on the same page about tomorrow morning, please note that we're still trying to lock in the Today show. Savannah Guthrie seemed excited about it when the Chair and I spoke to her on Saturday. So what we'll do is we'll lock in New Day for a 6:30AM hit leaving us flexibility for Today afterwards.
