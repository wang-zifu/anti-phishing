Since we told you Barbara Comstock outraised us, online donations are 
SURGING for John.

Now, we must seize the opportunity to stop Comstock dead in her tracks for 
good.

All gifts are TRIPLE MATCHED, but only through midnight.

WASHINGTON POST: Barbara Comstock outraises John Foust in third quarter

There's no "tomorrow" any more.

The election is only 13 days out and we're dangerously behind our goal.

If we don't raise $10,000 by midnight. We'll be in deep trouble.

We promised ourselves we wouldn't let Boehner buy another election. We 
promised we'd have the grassroots power to fight back. We don't want to 
see this election end this way.

Please - Can you chip in to our Rapid Response fund today?
