I did get the book to Hillary and the President.

If she wants to to get together to talk through implications, I=92m happy t
o do that.

I=92m in NYC the beginning of the week and DC later in the week, but also, 
a lot of time in NY the following week.

You are going to win, by the way.

I think it will be Cruz.

Are you mad?, John says.
