off the record, I agree. We have to blame Republicans in Congress for the r
ise of Trump. We've worked a lot of great language into our narrative about
 how whether you go back to the Southern Strategy Nixon used, or 2002's aff
irmative action focus, or 2015 DOMA, or 2005/2006 immigration...and then of
 course the Republican Congress helping fuel the Tea Party...that they made
 their bed and now they're lying in it. Unfortunately, there is a faction w
ithin Clinton world that seems to be in the mindset that they can win witho
ut anyone else, and they're promoting the idea that the focus should be on 
showing how Republicans are shunning Trump because he's so extreme. They wo
rry that our narrative, the points you make about who to blame, make Trump 
look like everyone else, and thus a viable option.

I think we need downballot to be able to fuel the top of the ticket, so I d
isagree with their approach, and I'm never going to get state parties to we
lcome GOPers shunning Trump because we're trying to beat those too. Somethi
ng for you to be aware of.

Maybe some of the language at the end of my post today could be helpful?
