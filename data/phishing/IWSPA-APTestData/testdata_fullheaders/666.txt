We discussed the idea of throwing an elbow at Women in the World with John
and HRC today, and she was reluctant to touch the abortion issue. John
suggested focusing more on the inappropriateness of playing politics with
trafficking and Jake suggested hitting equal pay, and she seemed ok with
that. In general, she was open to a broader strategy over the next month of
trying to pin GOP candidates down on wedge issues, but doesn't want to
throw darts that won't land. If we use vaccine tweet as a model -- timely,
with Republicans divided and looking nutty -- she'll be happy.

So for tomorrow at Women in the World, below and attached is my new
proposed text.

First, at the top:

"Before we get started, I want to take a moment to recognize the
significance of what happened earlier today in Washington.  Finally, after
an unprecedented and unconscionable delay, Senate Republicans allowed a
vote to confirm Loretta Lynch as Attorney General.  This is a happy ending
to a shameful story.  It=E2=80=99s beyond belief that a talented and qualif
ied
African American woman nominated to be our nation=E2=80=99s chief law enfor
cement
officer was hung out to dry for months.  At a time when we face real
security and criminal justice challenges.  And, I=E2=80=99m sorry, but push
ing an
ideological agenda at the expense of survivors of human trafficking is as
low as it gets.  There=E2=80=99s going to be plenty of time for politics as
 we head
toward the next election.  But common sense and common decency should still
count for something, even in Washington.  That=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99m o
ut there working
for and talking about, and it=E2=80=99s what you should demand of anyone ru
nning
for office."

And then lower down, on page six:

"The United States ranks 65th out of 142 nations on equal pay.  We should
be number one!  And by the way, anyone running for President who doesn=E2
=80=99t
think women deserve to be paid as well as men should have to explain to the
American people exactly why not.   And this isn=E2=80=99t just about women.
  So
many of our families today depend on two incomes to make ends meet..."
