agree with Dillon, I think it could've been more like:

"John McCain helped create Trump by advancing the hyper partisan and divisi
ve politics that brought Sarah Palin to the national stage, so it's not sur
prising he's embracing Donald's divisive and dangerous campaign. But it's d
isappointing, and wrong for the people of Arizona and for our country to at
tack immigrants and lie about the border. As a member of the Gang of 8 McCa
in knows better, which makes his pandering to extremists all the more troub
ling."

Seems like we should be hitting more on Trump and McCain being two peas in 
the same pod rather than calling on McCain to stand up to Trump?
