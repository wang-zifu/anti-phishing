A surge of violence

Amy,

Help Tip Stand up for IsraelViolence against the global Jewish community surged on the eve of Passover this year: A modern-day Nazi targeted Jews in Kansas City across two different centers of Jewish life, while in Hebron Palestinian terrorists riddled a family car with bullets on its way to a Passover Seder. Inside were a father, who was killed, his pregnant wife, who was severely injured, and their young children.

Our thoughts are with the families of those lost, and with these horrific acts of violence and terror comes a determination to expose the anti-Semitism and demonization of Israel and Jews that fuels such violence.  

Hatred is making a resurgence – and Israel’s most vocal detractors are using the media to spread smears and whip up animosity against the Jewish people and the Jewish state. 

This is why The Israel Project (TIP) exists: to get out the truth about Israel and her detractors, educate the media and help shape the story and the debate, in the U.S., Israel, and around the world in order to protect Israel, America and the Jewish people for generations to come.

We’ve reached thousands of people this year – but we need to reach thousands more, before anti-Israel forces get to them first. Please, make a donation of $18 or more to The Israel Project and help us raise $7,000 by April 30 – with your help, there’s nothing we can’t do.

Here are some of the remarkable accomplishments your support has made possible in this month, alone:

We’ve held briefings and conference calls with experts in the field on the most pressing topics in the region, such as Iran, Syria, the peace process, and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.

We’ve provided rapid response and analysis of the events taking shape in the region, through domain.com, The Tower Magazine, and our Arabic media language news site, al-domain.com.

We’ve engaged hundreds of thousands of reporters, opinion elites and activists through email campaigns, online petitions, and microsites, including domain.com and domain.com, educating and galvanizing support to support Israel and stop Iran.

Israel’s future, and the safety of Jews everywhere, are more uncertain than they’ve been in decades. In recent years, we have seen rampages in Europe targeting Jewish schoolyards and children. From Hezbollah’s tens of thousands of missiles to Iran’s nuclear drive, the Jewish state that we love is still in peril. 

Because of your support, t
