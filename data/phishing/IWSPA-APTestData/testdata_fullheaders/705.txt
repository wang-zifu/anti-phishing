If Hillary Clinton is seriously considering supporting any cut in social se
curity and/or an increase in the retirement age there may be an argument fo
r voters to cast a protest vote for Bernie in Iowa and New Hampshire. I wil
l soon be writing a column calling for an increase in social security finan
ced by a speculation transaction tax and will directly address HRCS positio
n based on whatever it is when I write the column. Seniors will be livid wh
en they realize they will get no social security cola when their cost of li
ving keeps rising.

CREDO Action released the following statement in response to a report
<<<link>>

that Secretary Hillary Clinton did not rule out cuts to Social Security and
raising the retirement age in her remarks at a campaign event in New
Hampshire on Wednesday:

=E2=80=9CDemocratic primary voters deserve to know exactly where Secretary 
Clinton
stands on Social Security=2C=E2=80=9D said Murshed Zaheed=2C CREDO=E2=80=99
s deputy political
director. =E2=80=9CSec. Clinton needs to draw a line in the sand and make i
t clear
that she will veto any bill that cuts Social Security benefits or raises
the retirement age.=E2=80=9D

Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s full remarks on Social Security at Wednesday=E2

 found below:

Yes you know=2C I think there are three parts to what we have to do with
social security and the first is we really have to defend social security
from the continuing efforts by some to privatize it=2C which I have been
studying and opposing for a long time because the numbers just don=E2=80=99
t work
out. And in the Bush administration when I was in the Senate I was one of
the leaders in the fight against the Bush plan to privatize and it is
something that I number 1=2C we=E2=80=99ll focus on: we are not going to pr
ivatize
social security. Secondly=2C I am concerned about those people on social
security who are most vulnerable in terms of what their monthly payout is.
That is primarily divorced=2C widowed=2C single women who either never work
ed
themselves or worked only a little so they have either just their own
earnings to depend on or they had a spouse who also was a low wage worker
and the first and most important task I think is to make sure that we get
the monthly payment for the poorest social security recipients up. So that
would be the first thing I would look at. Thirdly=2C we do have to consider
ways to make sure that the funding of social security does maintain the
system. I think we have a number of options=2C this would be something that
 I
would look at=2C I do not favor raising the retirement age. And I don=E2=80
=99t favor
it because it might be fine for somebody like me=2C but the vast majority o
f
working people who have worked hard and have had a difficult=2C maybe last
couple of decades trying to continue to work=2C it would be very challengin
g
for them. If there were a way to do it that would not penalize or punish
laborers and factory workers and long distance truck drivers and people who
really are ready for retirement at a much earlier age=2C I would consider i
t.
But I have yet to find any recommendation that I would think would be
suitable. And I want to look at raising the cap=2C I think that=E2=80=99s s
omething
we should look at how we do it=2C because I don=E2=80=99t want it to be an 
extra
burden on middle class families and in some parts of the country=2C you kno
w=2C
there=E2=80=99s a different level of income that defines middle class. So w
hat do
we skip and what level do we start at? And we have to consider that. So
those are my three priorities in looking at social security.
