*Hillary Clinton Raises $55 Million in Fourth Quarter*

*$37 Million for Primary Campaign, $18 Million for Democratic Party*

Thanks to the support of hundreds of thousands of people across the
country, Hillary for America set a new record for the best off-year
fundraising of any non-incumbent in history.  At the beginning of this
campaign, Hillary Clinton set a goal of $100 million in primary
contributions for 2015 and blew past that goal, raising more than $112
million in primary money for the year.  Clinton=E2=80=99s $37 million in pr
imary
dollars in the fourth quarter set a new record for the best off-year Q4 for
a non-incumbent.  In addition to the money raised for her campaign, Clinton
raised more than $18 million for the Organizationand State Parties across the
country through the Hillary Victory Fund in the fourth quarter.

Clinton raised roughly as much for the primary as President Obama did
during 2015 as a sitting president and more than either Clinton or Obama in
2007 despite having one fewer quarter to raise.

"Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have joined together
and powered this historic campaign, we are now heading into Iowa and New
Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful," said Hillary for
America Campaign Manager Robby Mook.  "Helping Democratic candidates win up
and down the ticket is a top priority for Hillary Clinton which is why
she's also proud to be doing her part to ensure Democrats have the
resources we need to win."
