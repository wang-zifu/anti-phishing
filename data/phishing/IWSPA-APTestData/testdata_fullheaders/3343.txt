We know that there have been a lot of changes taking place throughout the company. While these changes can be difficult, they are necessary to position the business for sustainable success in the continually evolving marketplace in which we compete. 




Another essential part of our future success involves better harnessing the talent and potential of our employees. We want all SPE employees to understand their contribution to the company and play a role in enhancing the performance of the business. In order to accomplish that, we are moving away from traditional, backward-looking performance reviews and toward a holistic approach focused on conversations about an employee’s current contributions and future growth. 




This new philosophy for nurturing talent and building relationships is called C3, and it was created to complement our strategic transition to a more nimble, collaborative workforce. C3 helps employees connect to and reflect on their previous experience, present performance and future plans in preparation for meetings with their managers. C3 enables employees to converse with their managers without the pressure of a formal rating or written review. This type of dialogue will allow people to have more frequent and open conversations. As part of those conversations, employees are encouraged to work with their managers to create focused career development plans that move the employee’s skills, responsibilities and future forward.




I believe this evolution in our approach to talent development will facilitate learning and collaboration across the company. Leveraging our competitive advantages, most especially the talent of our people, is essential to staying ahead in this rapidly changing market.




You will be hearing more about C3 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can learn more now by visiting the C3 website, which contains additional information about the principles underpinning C3, reflections from executives about each of the three Cs, and dates for upcoming
