Smaller group - Make sure Donna knows this particular segment is an ongoing
 commitment. We need someone who is always available at 8:20am on Weds and 
responsive (via text at least) when I'm locking in each week's topic & brie
fing. For this one, I won't book anyone who I can't directly reach. Let's g
ive her until COB today. Otherwise lets go with someone else for this one.

Note: if this doesn't work out for her we'll have one-off segments on SIRIU
S's "Progress" and "Urban" stations that might be better for Donna if she w
ants them.
