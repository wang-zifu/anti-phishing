Subject: Doctor this AM

Hi User, Mark, and Walker,

Just writing to let you know that I'm not feeling too well this AM, so I'm 
going to see the doctor. Will make my way to the office afterwards.

In terms of what I have going today, the main thing is the Orange County re
lease. Still waiting to get confirmation from reporter that it'll get writt
en up, but it's looking good. Also, the press conference in Washington stat
e last Friday went very well. Sent coverage around on Saturday.

-Walter
