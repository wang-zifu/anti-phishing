BREAKING NEWS

Every once in a while there is a nice opportunity that knocks on the door. The
general market is so saturated with overvalued companies at the moment that
amazing opportunities are becoming an extremely rare thing these days. One of my
analyst friends gave me a call last week and told me that
user@domain.com@user@domain.com
is about to soar like never before. This is a company that was worth 30 cents a
share at the beginning of the summer. Now we can buy
user@domain.com@user@domain.com
for just 3cents. You heard right, 3 cents. This is the best move of the summer
for sure especially since he told me we ll see user@domain.com@user@domain.com
hit 10 cents+ this week.
