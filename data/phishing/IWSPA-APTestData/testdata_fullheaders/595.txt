MARKUPDATE

GOP Senators Introduce 400 Ways To "Just Say No" To Reform

 *   Senators Coburn, Enzi, McCain and other obstructionist senators today 
introduced nearly 400 ways to "just say no" to health care reform that will
 lower costs and increase choice for hard-working Americans.

 *   Playing politics instead of pursuing reform, they are introducing ridi
culous amendments whose sole goal is to delay and obstruct the process. For
 instance, they have introduced:

    *   Two separate amendments that would force doctors to spy on each oth
er (Coburn 11, 87).

    *   "Name-calling" amendments that do nothing except make silly title c
hanges - like an amendment to rename the prevention and public health inves
tment fund - the "Slush Fund for Special Interests" (Coburn 18).

    *   For more examples, see the illustrative list below.

 *   At a time when health care costs are crushing hard-working American fa
milies, businesses and dragging down our economy<<<link>>
s.org/issues/2008/12/health_imperative.html> - is this really a productive 
use of time?

 *   By contrast, today a bipartisan group led by former Senators Tom Dasch
le, Bob Dole and former Secretary of State Howard Baker released<<<link>>
.domain.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hL8Vyx9jlIHpOKVVVGk0V62TgrRwD98S9AD
O0> a good-faith, intellectually serious effort at crafting a bipartisan so
lution to our health care crisis.

The Coburn/Burr Alternative Unravels The Employer-Based System And Keeps In
surance Companies In Charge.

 *   The Coburn/Burr plan does not provide sufficient protection for patien
ts against abusive insurance company practices - like denying coverage to p
eople with pre-existing conditions.

    *   Today, insurance companies use the flimsiest reasons to deny people
 coverage - for instance, a woman in Los Angeles was denied coverage for he
r breast cancer because she failed to disclose that she had visited a derma
tologist<<<link>>
22926&elq=3DFF7F3164F1874AF8B288CE0B3CDC1A75>.

    *   Under the Coburn plan, insurance companies could continue this prac
tice - called "rescission," which "has left thousands of Americans burdened
 with costly medical bills despite paying insurance premiums<<<link>>

74AF8B288CE0B3CDC1A75>," according to the L.A. Times.

 *   The Coburn/Burr plan would unravel the employer based system, and domain.com
ace it with an insufficient tax domain.com that doesn't even cover half of the 
average family's medical costs.

    *   The $5,700-per-family tax subsidy<<<link>>

verage American family paid for health care in 2008<<<link>>
