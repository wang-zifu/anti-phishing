He just can=92t help himself.

Gramm: Unlike The Rest Of Americans, McCain Supporters Aren=92t =91Economic
ally Illiterate=92 =91Whiners=92=BB

In a July interview with the Washington Times, former senator Phil Gramm in
famously decried the =93constant whining=94 of the American people when it 
comes to the economy, saying it was nothing more than a =93mental recession
=94:

=93We have sort of become a nation of whiners,=94 he said. =93You just hear
 this constant whining, complaining about a loss of competitiveness, Americ
a in decline=94 despite a major export boom that is the primary reason that
 growth continues in the economy, he said.

=93We=92ve never been more dominant; we=92ve never had more natural advanta
ges than we have today,=94 he said. =93We have benefited greatly=94 from th
e globalization of the economy in the last 30 years.

Gramm, known as Sen. John McCain=92s =93econ brain,=94 was swiftly criticiz
ed. Today, Gramm stood by his comments that America was a nation of whiners
, but made an exception for McCain supporters. From his remarks to supporte
rs at a Financial Services Roundtable in Minnesota:

If you=92re sitting here today, you=92re not economically illiterate and yo
u=92re not a whiner, so I=92m not worried about who you=92re going to vote 
for.

When asked about his involvement in the McCain campaign, Gramm simply repli
ed today, =93I=92m a supporter.=94 But he may actually be involved in a mor
e active capacity. Recently, he was spotted with the campaign=92s top advis
ers. He is also reportedly still serving as an adviser and a surrogate, spe
aking for the campaign.

Maybe McCain=92s wealthy supporters aren=92t whining because they=92re set 
to receive millions in tax cuts under the senator=92s plans.
