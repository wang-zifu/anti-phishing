Dear Mr. Michael Lynton and Ms. Jamie Alter,

Dear Supporters,

We'd love for you to join us at our upcoming special gathering in recognition of your support for Teach For America on the evening of Tuesday, October 7th in West Los Angeles. 

This event will bring together a select group of our most generous supporters for hors d'oeuvres, mingling and stimulating conversation with author Elizabeth Green. Each guest who RSVPs will receive a copy of her new book, Building a Better Teacher, and have the chance to meet corps members, staff, and other TFA supporters. Because of your commitment to educational equity, we think this is an evening you will truly enjoy.

Please take a moment to RSVP to let us know whether or not you are able to attend. We look forward to seeing you in October!

Best,

- Lida Jennings & Sheryl Sokoloff
