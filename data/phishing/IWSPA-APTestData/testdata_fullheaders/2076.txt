                                                Dear Readers,
If the best things in life are free, why does software cost so
much? Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the domain.com was
the Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your
software--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for
free. Now, even Yahoo is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client.
But if you look closely enough, you can still find some
worthwhile free apps. We've reviewed four free e-mailers to get you started. And we've also
taken a peek at the new BearShare, which is not only
free itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no
cost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is
another matter entirely.

Roundup: CNET reviews four free Web e-mailers
Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail
   dumps accounts without so much as an explanation. So-called
   free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as
   before. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another
   look at so-called "free" e-mailers.



Get the gear you need to burn DVDs
DVD authoring is one of the hottest new hobbies around, but
   picking out the right equipment can be a daunting task.
   We've broken down the process and selected the best gear
   for the job, from camera to software, burner to DVD player.



BearShare 4.0
The latest version of this oft-overlooked Gnutella client
   lets you pay $19.95 for ad-free file sharing and offers a
   nice, clean interface and a chat client to boot. Plus,
   BearShare lets you opt out of bundled adware and spyware
   when you install it. Should you run to this app like a bear
   to honey? Not yet. We'll tell you why.

Yahoo Mail  
After months of beta testing and pricing adjustments (that's right, Yahoo now charges for some services), the new Yahoo Mail just hit the Web. Among its changes are a complete redesign, better Calendar and Address Book integration, and a new color palette. Find out if Yahoo still deserves your account.

First Take: ICQ Lite Alpha



 One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its
   bloated feature set. Now, the company has released a new
   "lite" ICQ that sucks up far less system memory than the
   full-fat version--but at what cost? We take a first look. 




SBC Yahoo Dial



 Thanks to a partnership with SBC Pacific Bell, Yahoo is now
   in the dial-up game. The new service, known as SBC Yahoo
   Dial, offers a customized browser, 25MB of storage, and 11
   e-mail addresses--all for $21.95 or lower, depending on
   your SBC service package. Our reviewer investigates.

First Take: Winamp3 Release Candidate

   We've been waiting aeons for the newest version of popular
   media player Winamp. We haven't received a full new version
   yet, but AOL has partially obliged with a prerelease
   version. Winamp3 Release Candidate serves up a new interface
   and some major underlying changes. But does the new look
   muddy up Winamp's legendary ease of use?

 Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops
   up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s)
   from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have
   QuickTime set as your default media player for all media
   files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date,
   whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply
   upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade
   feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select domain.com >
   Preferences > QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled
   "Check for updates automatically."



   If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player,
   open that program, click Tools > Options. Select the Formats
   tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that
   you want Windows Media Player to open. To make sure that
   QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those
   file types within QuickTime.
