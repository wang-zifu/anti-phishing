Larry, 

We have met a few times, both here in a LA at Ari's house and on Martha's Vineyard with Patrick and Eric.  But I never get a chance to actually have a chance to have a conversation with you.   Jeff Garlin is a friend from our kids' school going way back and from work and he suggested that I write or call you.   I don't play golf, so I can't invite you to that.  But I do eat so I wanted to know if you might want to have lunch together.  If so I would love do that when you have the time.  Hope the fall is treating you well.

Best,
Michael Lynton
