This week is National Infrastructure Week, which is a shared campaign of the AFL-CIO, the Chamber of Commerce and other groups representing a coalition of labor and business.

Labor and business agree that we need to repair, improve, and expand America's crumbling infrastructure. Yet Republicans continue to block infrastructure spending that would create jobs, make roads and bridges safer, shorten commutes, and improve domain.com access for millions.

We're looking to do events in our key battleground states, and I wanted to get your take on how to localize this for North Carolina. Let me know when you have a moment to talk early this afternoon.
