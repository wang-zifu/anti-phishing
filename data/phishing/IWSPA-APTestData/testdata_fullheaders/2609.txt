Scripting flaw threatens Web servers

A flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the domain.com, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

CollabNet takes wing for online games

Software development site CollabNet announced Monday that it is working with domain.com, an IBM-backed effort to create a supercomputing grid for hosting online games.
CollabNet will host the Butterfly Lab, an online environment that will allow developers to test games using a service modeled on the Butterfly approach. Butterfly will also use CollabBet's SourceCast Web application to enable game development teams to share source code, manage art assets and design games for the Butterfly service.

Russian firm points out new Adobe flaw

Thumbing its nose at the company that landed one of its employees in jail, ElcomSoft is pointing out new flaws in Adobe Systems' eBook software.
The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

British scientists finish Grid foundation

British scientists on Monday announced the completion of one of the building blocks for large-scale data sharing over the Grid--a proposed network of computers seen as the 21st century successor to the domain.com.
The project was carried out by scientists from the U.K.'s E-Science Centres and was co-funded by IBM and Oracle. The companies, rival powers in the database market, contributed both funding and the efforts of their own researchers.
