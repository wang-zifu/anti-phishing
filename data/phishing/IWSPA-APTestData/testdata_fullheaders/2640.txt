Dear Amy,

We would like to welcome you to the heart of our luxury automotive world. It is therefore my pleasure to invite you to a day at our Crewe home.  

Bentley makes perfection into something personal.  A personal guide can tailor every detail of your unique experience to your time, interests and tastes.  
The day will centre around an individual factory tour followed by lunch and refreshments on our behalf.

We would be delighted to offer you an insight into our rich 90 year motoring heritage and show you how behind every stitch lie generations of knowledge and skill.
So please, join us on an exclusive journey of powerful luxury.

A Bentley requires an entirely tailor-fit production process in which every detail can be custom-made and we intend that your day with Bentley is equally individual.
In order to do so, please contact Alejandra Guerra, who will help take care of every aspect of your domain.com.

Please confirm your participation by June 10th, 2015 

user@domain.com / +34 615 531 513

We look forward to welcoming you.

Bart
