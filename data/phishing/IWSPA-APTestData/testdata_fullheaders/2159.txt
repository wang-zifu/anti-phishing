I=E2=80=99m on a plane and m first flight had spotty wifi.

I don=E2=80=99t know what others comments are but you can read just the tra
cked
changes in Iran section and decide with her which she likes.   I don=E2=80
=99t
think the =E2=80=9Chard choices=E2=80=9D reference works but I=E2=80=99ll l
eave that to you.  It=E2=80=99s
the title of her book and while this may be one of them I would rather she
just sound definitive about what she=E2=80=99s saying on this rather than d
efining
what leadership is about.  I think the point of her comments has to come
through. Maybe I=E2=80=99m overthinking but it just doesn=E2=80=99t hit me 
right.

For what it=E2=80=99s worth, I hate the yelling/screaming/trump graph.  It 
sounds
completely contrived and doesn=E2=80=99t deliver a big joke or a big point.

I realize I=E2=80=99m out of town given that I=E2=80=99m on a plane. So I w
on=E2=80=99t weigh in on
anything else. Obviously didn=E2=80=99t have much of chance given I had to 
travel
starting at 5 AM

Sharing my latest Wing Ding draft. I'm planning on making a few tweaks to
the Iran section and looking to cut several hundred words, which I don't
think will be tough. On first blush, HRC is liking this more than before,
but we'll see.

Thanks
