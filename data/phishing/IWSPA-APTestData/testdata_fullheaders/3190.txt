I've been speaking with Jonae about this and User is on the chain. He'll keep everyone posted.

Guys, question for Mark and User. Comms staffer might be necessary for more than staffing the chair if reporters hungry for a story are going to be wandering around and trying to interview state party officials.

Thanks for handling Deshundra, I had checked with Garrett last week on this (since it's my region) and he had told me something similar, a comms staffer might go if we book her on an outlet outside of this event. This particular meeting is going to be a quick in and out before the chair heads to FL
