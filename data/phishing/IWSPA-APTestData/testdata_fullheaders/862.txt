The one on the calendar is, I think, a reference to a Congressional Convention.

The state convention actually occurred on March 4 in Buffalo.

CPAC was also going on in DC at that time and we were not really paying attention to state conventions. None of our candidates attended as they mostly had events elsewhere that day.

Sorry for the confusion.

Best,
