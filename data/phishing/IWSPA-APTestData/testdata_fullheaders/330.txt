I could do tomorrow at NY 1:30 – after that I am on a plane to South America.   If that isn’t feasible, Thursday after  NY 1:00 (I’ll be an hour ahead) could work as well.

I am quite open on Thursday. Unfortunately today is impossible. If tomorrow works for Leah I could be flexible other than NY 11:30-12:30.

Mark, Nicole & Leah,




Please let me know your windows of availability this Thursday to discuss strategy for handling the Nadia Guo situation.  The anticipated interview of Ms. Guo is next Tuesday, to be preceded by an interview of Li Chow next Monday.
