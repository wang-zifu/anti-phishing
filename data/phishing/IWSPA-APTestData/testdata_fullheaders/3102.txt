Two key facts about Koch Industries that deserve more attention than
they get:




1) They made millions by stealing oil from native American reservations
and federal land (i.e., taxpayers.)




2) They've been hit with some of the largest fines for environmental
damage in U.S. history, including what was at the time (and may still
be) the largest civil penalty in the history of the Clean Water Act.




Here's a good overview; there's more out there:
<<link>>




(OK, one more: Koch was a key funder of an almost-certainly illegal
Republican campaign finance scheme during the 1996 elections that
involved laundering excess contributions through PACs and controversial
use of non-domain.com organizations to run attack ads.  The (GOP-controlled)
Senate committee investigating  controversial 1996 Democratic
fundraising abruptly halted its investigation when damaging information
tying some Senate Republicans to the Koch/TRIAD scheme started to come
out.)

Right-Wing Billionaire David Koch Funding SwiftBoat Campaign Against
Global Warming Science
<<<link>>> 




<<link>>




Right-wing billionaire David Koch
<<<link>>
12/06/in_glitzy_shadows_a_health_reform_foe_lurks/> , who along with his
brother Charles owns the oil and gas empire Koch Industries, constantly
presents himself as a champion of science. Next year, a wing of the
Smithsonian will be named after him because of his generous donations.
Indeed, in accepting Koch's donations, the Smithsonian Human Origins
Program director Rick Potts attempted towhitewash Koch's philanthropist
history <<<link>>> :




POTTS: What we find in David Koch is a person who's committed to doing
things for the American public that has no relationship to politics




Koch apparently relishes this perception that his money buys. In an
interview earlier this year, Koch pretended that he opposes
organizations which politicize and distort science
<<<link>>> :




Q: What role do you think politics should play in educating the public
about evolution?




KOCH: That's an interesting question. I think politicians should really
stay out of it and allow scientists to present the facts and
discoveries. I hate to see it politicized.




In an op-ed in the Boston Globe
<<<link>>
12/06/in_glitzy_shadows_a_health_reform_foe_lurks/>  yesterday, I
observed that Koch has manufactured a positive image for himself by
giving to laudable causes, while at the same time, quietly "funneling
tens of millions of dollars
<<<link>>
12/06/in_glitzy_shadows_a_health_reform_foe_lurks/>  to more
subterranean efforts that reflect his conservative politics." Despite
his funding of the Smithsonian, Koch has done more to politicize and and
undermine the public's understanding of science than any other single
person. Koch has funded the leading groups dedicated to spreading
skepticism of climate change:




- Koch's Americans for Prosperity, the right-wing tea party group which
Koch founded in 1984
<<<link>>
12/06/in_glitzy_shadows_a_health_reform_foe_lurks/>  and continues to
finance, has just announced that it will send a team of political
operatives to Copenhagen for the United Nations Climate Change
Conference. AFP intends to hold a press conference to attack any climate
change solution the President promises as a mistake that will "kill jobs
here" and "infringe on our personal and national freedoms
<<<link>>>
."




- Koch has funded the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has been
the most aggressive conservative front group heralding hacked e-mailsas
proof that climate change
<<<link>>>  does not exist.




- Koch funds the "Hot Air Tour
<<<link>>> ," a campaign led by
lobbyists
<<<link>>

science underpinning climate change. The tour also features an actual
hot air balloon to illustrate their beleif that climate change science
is just "hot air."




The National Academy of Sciences, the US Global Change Research Program,
and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have all come to the
same conclusion
<<<link>>
/2009/12/07/dont_suppress_debate_win_it/> : "that carbon dioxide
emissions from fossil fuel use and the loss of carbon-sink capacity in
heavily timbered forests are increasing temperatures and making oceans
more acidic." David Koch's Koch Industries derives much of its domain.com
from its oil refineries, one of the major emitters of carbon dioxide,
and from its George-Pacific timber subsidiary, one of the largest
contributors to the loss of carbon-sink capacity. So while it's clear
Koch's bottom line is in conflict with the addressing the world's
climate crisis, it should also be clear that he is no champion of
science - no matter how many halls he buys at the Smithsonian.
