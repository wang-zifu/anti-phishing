Mr. user,

As I am sure that you are quite busy with the 2015 elections, I will 
make this as succinct as possible. My name is Nick Mastron, and I am a 
current PhD student in Public Policy & Administration at George 
Washington University. Originally, my plan was to take your 
Congressional Investigations class in Spring 2015 through the Consortium 
program of D.C. universities. Will you be teaching this class in Spring 
2016? If you are, in fact, unable to teach this seminar due to electoral 
obligations, I wanted to share with you now what I had hoped to share in 
class.

I=E2=80=99m young, 23 to be exact, and came straight from undergraduate 
to this doctoral program. Originally from Memphis, TN, I grew up middle 
class, volunteered in many community service organizations, and 
graduated from a public high school and university. In essence, I lived 
the American dream, but my parents always taught me that this dream 
comes at the price of service. So, starting in first grade, I became 
enamored with government and its politics. My interest did not stop 
there and I spent a great deal of my time in college getting hands on 
experience by working on campaigns, some issue-based and one official 
campaign team (Steve Cohen 2012). Memphis, to me though, always 
represented the political crossroads of America, and I witnessed why 
public servants are so desperately needed. Over time this political 
predisposition evolved into a second love for policymaking and 
execution. Hence, when the opportunity came, I moved to D.C. to learn 
how to both cultivate the best policies for building a stronger nation 
as well as how to manage the most dire political situations. In short, I 
do not want to be an academic: I want to serve my country on the home 
front.

Currently, I hope to one day serve as a top policy advisor on campaigns 
for people I believe will work toward rebuilding and reinvesting in the 
land of hope and dreams. Ideally, I hope to be a White House 
Chief-of-Staff or a Deputy Chief-of-Staff, anchoring a progressive but 
rational cohort of dedicated public servants. My government career 
begins this summer, as I will be interning as a regulatory economist at 
the Small Business Administration=E2=80=99s Office of Advocacy.  In your 
professional opinion, are these worthwhile career goals and objectives 
that would best serve the American public? I have attached my r=C3=A9sum=C3
=A9 for your domain.com to paint a better picture of what I am capable of 
accomplishing.

Finally, I am an enormous supporter of the Center for American Progress, 
as it intersects politics and policy to hold leaders to a higher 
accountability in decision making. In this same domain.com, I seek 
experiences in other agencies, think tanks, and campaigns. Having long 
admired various endeavors, how does one create and sustain this 
multifaceted career?

So in summary I ask 3 questions:
1. Will you be teaching Congressional Investigations in Spring 2016?
2. If you were in my shoes, how can I best serve the United States of 
America?
3. How does one create and maintain a diverse career in the various 
political arenas?

I understand that you probably will be unable to respond quickly, but I 
just wanted to reach out and domain.com a bit of information and advice.

Thanks for listening, and I look forward to any response I might 
receive.

Sincerely,

Nicholas Mastron
