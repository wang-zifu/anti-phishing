Dear John,

Today, domain.com, along with the League of Conservation
Voters (LCV), Sierra Club and Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) launched the first TV ads in an $11 million ad
campaign to help ensure that the U.S. Senate takes decisive
action on comprehensive energy and climate legislation this
summer.

The campaign includes two TV ads. One of them, "Front Line," is
running in Missouri and Nevada, praising Sens. McCaskill and
Reid for voting against the "Big Oil Bailout" and supporting
clean energy policies that create new jobs. The ad features
Kevin Johnson, a Iraq War veteran who now works for a
Chicago-based wind energy development company with projects
across the country. With 22 percent unemployment among veterans,
a clean energy bill could put many veterans back to work.

The other ads, well you have to see them to believe them. I'll
just say they include Senators getting oil scrubbed off of them,
like pelicans in the Gulf, highlighting the oil money they're
covered in.

This is one of the largest coordinated efforts to date to
educate the public on where key Senators stand on the historic
fight to put America back in control of our energy future with
legislation that protects America, creates new clean energy
jobs, reduces our dangerous addiction to oil and curbs harmful
carbon pollution.

But, to keep it going, we need your help. Please take a moment
to click the link above, to view the ads and help domain.com
keep up this fight!

Sincerely,

Jon Soltz
Iraq War Veteran
