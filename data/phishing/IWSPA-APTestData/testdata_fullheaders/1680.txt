SL: OrganizationStatement on Paul Ryan Refusing to Endorse Donald Trump
"Well, that was awkward. Paul Ryan - the highest-ranking Republican in the country, and chair of the Republican National Convention - just said he can't support Dangerous Donald Trump's nomination for president. Even Ryan recognizes that Trump's dangerous rhetoric is about to start poisoning down-ballot races, including his own previously safe seat in Wisconsin. But he and his fellow House Republicans have no one to blame but themselves: they paved the way for the GOP to become the party of Trump with their own extreme rhetoric, divisive policies, and obstruction. But bring a hazmat domain.com if you're one of the remaining Republican leaders still planning to stand with your nominee - Trump has gone radioactive." - Mark Paustenbach, OrganizationNational Press Secretary
