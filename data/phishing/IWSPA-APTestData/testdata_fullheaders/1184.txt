We've hit the Tyson endorsement over rape several times, we never mention his ability to vote.

I think we're cool with Tyson. No one's saying he shouldn't be allowed to vote.
I honestly don't think we should insult Bobby Knight using the chair's voice but that's just my 2 cents

Given our support for restoration of civil rights/voting rights for ex felons and progressive support for ban the box initiatives, do we open ourselves up for backsplash with the Tyson mention?
