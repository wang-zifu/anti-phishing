Producers Have Reached a Deal with the DGA

I am pleased to report that we have reached a new three year deal with the DGA, subject to ratification.  The DGA will meet with its Board tomorrow morning and shortly thereafter they will issue a limited press release.  The DGA has requested, and we have agreed, not to publish any specifics of the deal until it has had an opportunity to communicate with its members.  The DGA is concerned that any leaks of the details of the deal may compromise the ratification of the agreement.  I will send a follow-up e-mail with the significant deal points to you over the next couple of days and will schedule meetings with our business groups to review the deal, as soon as practicable. The deal is within the parameters approved by the CEO’s and contains the “gets” needed by  television distribution.
