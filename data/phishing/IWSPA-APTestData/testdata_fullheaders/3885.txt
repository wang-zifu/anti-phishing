	We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto your Online Banking account,
 and multiple 
	password failures were present before the logons.We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us.

	If this is not completed by November 6, 2008, we will be forced to suspend your account indefinitely,
 as it may have been
	used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner.
