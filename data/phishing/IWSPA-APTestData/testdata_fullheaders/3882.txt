Hi!

You've been selected to apply for the PREMIER Gold Visa Card!

With your new PREMIER Gold Visa Card, you can re-build or strengthen your domain.com with ease.

* Gold Card Prestige
* Rebuild or strengthen your domain.com
* Reporting to the 4 major domain.com bureaus
* 24 Hour Phone and Online Account Access

<>

The program is designed to help you re-establish a positive domain.com reference, while you enjoy the convenience of being a cardholder of one of the most widely accepted cards.  By making your payments on time and keeping your balance below the domain.com domain.com, you may be able to rebuild your domain.com.

Rebuilding better and stronger domain.com is in your hands - do not domain.com any longer!

Thank you,

Dan Nicholson
Senior domain.com Manager
