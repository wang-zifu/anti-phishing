	Amy -- This is your last chance to TRIPLE-MATCH your donation before tonight’s midnight deadline.




						TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE until 11:59pm



	There could NOT be a better time to do it:

		Control of Congress is at stake.



		The latest polls show we’re in a dead-heat.



		But we’re getting pummeled with Republican attacks.

	That is why President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi have been emailing you. This is an all hands on deck moment. We still need 2 donors from 90067 zip code  to TRIPLE-MATCH their gift by midnight if we want any chance of victory in the election. Amy, can you help us out before tonight’s deadline?MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Donations In Response To This Email Triple-Matched!Chip in $5 immediately >>Chip in $35 immediately >>Chip in $50 immediately >>Chip in $100 immediately >>Chip in $250 immediately >>Or click here to donate another amount.
