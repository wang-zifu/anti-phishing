John --

Here's the bad news (ok, TERRIBLE news): Andy Tobin took yet another 
massive check from the Koch Brothers.

Here's the good news (ok, AMAZING news): After hearing the news, two of 
Ann's strongest supporters agreed to MATCH ALL GIFTS through midnight 
tonight.

It's clear that Arizonans DON'T want the Koch Brothers interfering in 
their elections. If you agree, we need to hear from you right now.
