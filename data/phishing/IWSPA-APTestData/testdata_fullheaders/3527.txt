A Screen Dream

Good Mac screensavers are hard to come by. And screensavers are
important: not only do they preserve your screen quality, but
they can also turn your monitor into a conversation piece.
Marine Aquarium, our Pick of the Week, will turn your desktop
into a virtual tropical fish aquarium that will make your Mac
turn some heads. No need to feed:

Also this week, we've got QuickTime 6, the media player's long-
awaited first foray into MPEG-4 technology; Cartoon Editor, a
graphic editor that will help you make QuickTime cartoons;
MoonDock, so you can keep track of moon phases on your desktop;
WebDesign, a full-featured HTML editor with lots of extras; and
Sigma Chess Lite, so you can challenge your mind and develop
your skills at the ancient game of chess.

Enjoy!
