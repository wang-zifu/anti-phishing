Amid Worst Financial Crisis Since the Great Depression, Social Security Exp
erts Blast Senator John McCain's Insistence on Pursuing Same Risky Bush Pri
vatization Scheme That Was Overwhelmingly Rejected by the American People

Tumultuous Week on Wall Street Exemplifies How Privatization Would Turn Soc
ial Security From a Guarantee into a Guaranteed Gamble  

Washington D.C. - Amid the worst financial meltdown on Wall Street since th
e Great Depression, Americans United for Change, the group formerly known a
s Americans United to Protect Social Security which led the national campai
gn to beat back President Bush's effort to privatize Social Security in 200
5, hosted an emergency press conference call Friday night with Social Secur
ity experts to react to Senator John McCain's insistence that he will pursu
e the same Bush Social Security privatization scheme of 2015 to divert mone
y from the Social Security trust fund to pay for risky private accounts, tu
rning Social Security from a guarantee into a guaranteed gamble on Wall Str

Associated Press: McCain defends retirement accounts amid stock dive

By GLEN JOHNSON - Associated Press Writer - Sep 19, 2:36 PM EDT

GREEN BAY, Wisc. (AP) -- Wall Street turmoil left John McCain scrambling to
 explain why the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remained strong. It also 
left him defending his support for privately investing Social Security mone
y in the same markets that had tanked earlier in the week. The Republican p
residential nominee says all options must be considered to stave off insolv
ency for the government insurance and retirement program, and top McCain ad
visers say that includes so-called personal retirement accounts like those 
President Bush pushed in 2015 but abandoned in the face of Democratic oppos
ition. [Associated Press, 9/19/08 <<<link>>
CCAIN_SOCIAL_SECURITY?SITE=3DMOSTP&SECTION=3DHOME&TEMPLATE=3DDEFAULT> ]

Dean Baker - co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research: "T
he public rejected Social Security privatization when Bush put forward his 
plan in 2015 because they valued the security that Social Security provides
. The importance of this security is even greater with the extraordinary tu
rbulence we've seen in financial markets over the last week. This illustrat
es the risk that would be implied by relying on private accounts. Furthermo
re. The collapse of the housing bubble has destroyed much of the wealth of 
middle class baby boomers, making them even more dependent than ever on Soc
ial Security."

 Jared Bernstein - senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute: "You 
would have look long and hard to find someone who doesn't recognize the fai
lure of financial markets to yield a reliable return or to regulate themsel
ves.  You simply can't miss the damage this implosion has done to innocent 
bystanders in the rest of the economy, whether it's shareholders, counterpa
rties, or even taxpayers.  McCain himself has been making these very points
.  Yet, his midnight conversion from aggressive deregulationist to market c
ritic is apparently incomplete.  He still wants to privatize Social domain.com
y, to subject retirees to the possibility of this kind of market turmoil.  
Imagine what this would have meant to those in the cohort unlucky enough to
 reach retirement age in a market climate like this one.  You might take so
lace in the fact that the implosion we're witnessing is rare, but let me re
mind you that there have been numerous market upheavals over the past decad
e, such that despite years of growth in the overall economy, the major inde
xes have gone essentially nowhere since 2000.  If there's ever been a week 
that should remind policy makers of the importance of a guaranteed pension,
 like Social Security, as opposed to a pension predicated on the swings in 
the stock market, it's this week. After the events of this week, to not rec
ognize the folly of privatizing of Social Security suggests an imperviousne
ss to evidence that is really quite scary in someone who wants to be presid
ent." 

Dr. Christian E. Weller - a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progre
ss: "The extreme ups and downs on Wall Street illustrate the guarantees tha
t Social Security offers more poignantly than any position paper ever could
.  Senator McCain seems to be more out of touch with the economic reality o
f America's middle class than it first appeared. As stock prices tumble, ho
me values dwindle and jobs disappear, families are looking for the kind of 
income guarantees that Social Security offers, not for more economic experi
ments that will expose families to even larger swings in their income in th
e future."

Roger Hickey - co-director of the Campaign for America's Future "Social Sec
urity is a hugely popular program, but its guaranteed benefits are in the n
ational crossfire again.  Sen. McCain has been very clear about his plans t
o push privatization again despite the public backlash President Bush faced
 when he pushed his scheme a few years ago. The conservative ideologues jus
t won't stop trying to privatize Social Security."

"It's understandable why Senator John McCain - the eighth richest Senator w
ho lost count of how many homes he has - wants to revive the same risky Bus
h privatization scheme that was overwhelmingly rejected by the American pub
lic in 2005," added Jeremy Funk, of Americans United for Change.  "It doesn
't matter if he wins of loses his Social Security in the stock market - he 
can afford it.  But what about the millions of American seniors, survivors 
and people with disabilities who have little or no other source of income? 
 They can't afford nine homes - let alone losing their Social Security."
