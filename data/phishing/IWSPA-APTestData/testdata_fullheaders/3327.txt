ASPToday announces their Inaugural Guru week

***Dan Wahlin expounds on XML Support in ASP.NET

ASPToday are proud to announce their first Guru Week. From 29th July to
2nd August Microsoft MVP, ASPToday author and domain.com/ founder
Dan Wahlin presents a series of specially commissioned articles, telling
you all you need to know about XML support in ASP.NET. Drawing on his
experience of consulting and XML training, Dan's articles will allow
anyone interested in XML to quickly get up to speed in this important
subject.

***Updating Data Safely with A DataSet, by Alex Homer

OK, so we cant store all three values for a row (the current, original
and the underlying values) in the tables of our DataSet. Is this actually
important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and what do
users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead
of three, (and dont you hate books that keep asking questions)?

Author Interviews

***With Franois Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual
Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook.

[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET
developer, and so who do you think needs this book?

[CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming
tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is
difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in
finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that
is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.

[PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and
regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are
the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a
great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the
regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight
in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work
with when writing the book.

[AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook

In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.
There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out
on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin
Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on
the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related
topics.

What is free threading? 

Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an
application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of
threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those
threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the
developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should
end, and what it should do while executing.

***C#Today Free Code Download

Due to customer feedback, C#Today have decided to try out something new
this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material
available to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox
Developer Community, which is free to join).

This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM 
<<link>>

The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate
source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET
facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a
complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel
object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together
these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to
develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in
code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which
attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an
existing C# or VB.NET project.

***Get on the Fast Track to Success

If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core
.NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for
you.

The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by
providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts
and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By
targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to
concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.
