[Debbie Robins Author] 2014: The Year Of Intention from Debbie	Robins, M.A.

Dearest friends, clients and colleagues,
Happy New Year! 

In my consulting practice, where I interface with many global business leaders and entrepreneurs, it was my experience that 2015 was a challenging year for most people either professionally, personally or both.  

As we head into the opportunities that domain.com us in 2014, please remember to be intentional about what you want to create this year.  

Intention is action taken in a conscious, designed, deliberate, reasoned and purposeful way. 

In my experience and training, intention setting is most successful when someone is witness to your vision and a plan is put in play. 

My intention this year is to serve as many people as I can to create rapid success in their professional lives. 

My intention is to assist more corporations, organizations and companies to create cultures that operate on the business model of a virtuous circle.  

A virtuous circle (or work environment) is where the company serves the employees needs...the employees serve the companies needs...the company serves the consumers needs...the company serves the communities needs…the company serves the needs of the world. The act of Service is the hyper-charged energy that generates profitability, sustainability and grows a workforce of happy human beings. Everyone wins. 

As an example, a virtuous circle is at the core of how Federal Express does business. The results are evident. 

Fact: When we serve, everything lifts inside of us. 

Fact: Winning in business (and in life) is an emotional experience. 

Fact: Emotional alignment to an agreed upon vision that is in service to the higher good makes the impossible possible. 

Be intentional this year. 

Be of service. 

You will get everything you want and more.
With loving, Deb Robins, M.A.
