Dear John, 

As we get closer to the election, I am cautiously hopeful.

Americans cast their ballots in just 35 days, and looking at the
polls, many of the Dirty Dozen are in a dead heat with their
opponents. We can defeat them, and make the environment a
priority with voters, but LCV needs your support now...so what
are you waiting for?

The deadline is midnight tonight. Give today and make sure the
Dirty Dozen doesn't see another term in office.

<<link>>

LCV is working hard to educate voters about the need for a
Congress that will lead us to a clean energy future. Your
support today will help LCV with this voter education effort,
along with their other important programs like publishing their
National Environmental Scorecard and lobbying decision-makers on
critical legislation.

There has never been an election quite like the one we face
today. LCV's phone banks to undecided voters are running
non-stop, their canvassing teams are educating voters every day,
and LCV's powerful pro-environment ads are up on the air in key
states. But they need your generous support now to keep these
efforts going all the way to the finish. Just look at what your
gift could help accomplish:

 * $50 will mean LCV canvassers can talk to 75 voters about the
importance of this election.
 * $100 will mean trained LCV organizers can make 100 phone
calls to undecided voters.
 * $500 will mean 20,000 people can see LCV's ads in key
battleground states.

Please contribute whatever you can to LCV's urgent efforts to
stop the Dirty Dozen and fund LCV's other valuable programs.

No one can afford to sit this one out, John, not now.
I'm working hard with Gene and my friends at the League of
Conservation Voters to make sure we are making the most of these
final weeks. But we aren't going to be able to kick the Dirty
Dozen out of Congress and make global warming a priority all on
our own. We urgently need your help.

Stand with me today and support the experienced, targeted, and
time-tested work of the League of Conservation Voters.

Thank you so much.

Sincerely,

Robert Redford
