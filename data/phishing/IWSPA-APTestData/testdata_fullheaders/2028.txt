John,

It was great to meet you at the Aspen Strategy Group. Given the short
amount of time, I feel I did not adequately answer the question you raised
during my presentation. The question about how government implements the
digital counter-insurgency is something I have thought a lot about. I
believe it starts with an understanding of the different technical
capabilities we need to win this fight and matching each of those
capabilities with the right arm of government (both in terms of expertise
and mandate). But a lot of this will be done outside government, which
means we need to really think about the right incentives for enlisting the
private sector. The current approach has put the companies on the
defensive, which means they have not been as willing to proactively help.
That being said, I have thoughts on how we can separate out the fight
against ISIS from the other more complex debates around encryption,
surveillance, etc.

If you are ever in New York, it would be great to continue the
conversation.

Best,
Jared
