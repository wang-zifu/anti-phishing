He asked me for help to tell you next:He tells me that he never accessed the VPS (I guarantee you he doesn´t know how, probably doesn´t know what are CentOS or SSH).He says HT provided the VPSs. Then I understand we contracted such servers so probably we still having same credentials than when we performed RCS installation.I do not know which FAE did it.I sorry not being more helpful with this topicThanks a lot--Sergio Rodriguez-Solís y GuerreroField Application EngineerHacking TeamMilan Singapore Washington DC <<<link>>> www.Organization.comemail:  <mailto:user@domain.com> user@domain.com: +34 608662179phone: +39 0229060603
