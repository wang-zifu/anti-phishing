SL: Guess Which Outlet Donald Trump Just Called "Professional"

After spending years of taking every opportunity to bash the freedom of the press, Donald Trump today, for one of the first times ever, admired any sort of media and reporting this cycle. And what outlet was the subject of his praise? You guessed it....The National Enquirer.

TRUMP: And then in the meantime, as you know, there was a picture a few weeks ago, and it was all over the place, that about Lee Harvey Oswald and his father a few months before...

HANNITY: Was that verified ever before....I saw something on the domain.com

TRUMP: It was a picture put in...and they wouldn't put it in if they couldn't be sued, that I can tell you. They are very big professionals. It was put in, and by the way, Ted Cruz I don't think denied it at the news conference. They don't do things unless they can be verified.
