RE: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 - INTERNATIONAL WEEKEND GROSSES

It didn’t really pop, but 50% above Cloudy puts with a realistic chance at our number. Apart from Wed and Sat/Sun there was absolutely no business so it is especially young…no animated film dominating the market and tracking on what is coming so far is soft (Lego actually opening on par with Cloudy 2 in first intl bows), so we have a shot…we NEED those vacations which begin on Saturday.

CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 earned $3.5 million on 1,665 screens in 27 markets overseas bringing its total to $145.8 million.




We had two new openings this week.  France debuted with $1.6 (50% bigger than the launch of CLOUDY 1) with several weeks of rolling school vacations ahead of us.  The Netherlands bowed to $.832 including previews.  Excluding previews, the opening is about even with CLOUDY 1 which had the domain.com of launching at the start of school vacations.  This year's school holidays begin next week.




Among our holdovers, Spain's cume now stands at $6.7, Turkey at $1.7 and Norway is $1.4




Please see current box-office status attached.




Best regards… Jay
