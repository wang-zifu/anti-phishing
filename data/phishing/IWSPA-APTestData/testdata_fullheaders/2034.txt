WITH FEAR-MONGERING LOBBYIST CHARLIE BLACK IN THE LEAD, MCCAIN CAN'T MAKE
THE CASE FOR CHANGE

Charlie Black is in the news again because of comments
<<<link>>
1979.html?nav=rss_politics>  he made saying that McCain would domain.com
politically from another terrorist attack.  This controversy is just the
latest for Black, who as a lobbyist has represented brutal human rights
dictators, lobbied for a company that did business with Iran and helped sell
the Iraq war. With Black and 134 lobbyists assisting the campaign, McCain is
running a classic, fear-and-smear -politics-as-usual operation.




"In terms of being able to distort or mislead people, you're never running
in the clear . Back in the 1970s, you could say all kinds of outrageous
things.  Now, in almost any state you go into, you've got at least one,
maybe four or five state newspapers that will call your hand.  Some of these
state capital press corps are tougher than the national guys." -- Charlie
Black [Washington Post, 1/17/89]




.         McCain and his campaign are taking a page right out of the
GOP-Rove playbook, using fear-and smear tactics to make their case to
voters. This week, it was reported that Charlie Black said that another
terrorist attack would be politically beneficial to McCain.




.         Charlie Black, lead McCain adviser, is an architect of fear and
smear campaigns that have sought election victories by dividing people and
scaring them.  He has mastered in his own words "being able to distort and
mislead people."




.         Like Bush, McCain has a history of using fear to help his
political career.




o      Days after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the McCain campaign
released a web video using footage of riots in the street and other images
of a dangerous world to question Mitt Romney's experience.  The Associated
Press reported, "McCain's campaign released an domain.com-only ad featuring
graphic images of a dangerous world and the tag line: 'Mitt Romney says the
next president doesn't need foreign policy experience.'  McCain defended the
images." [Associated Press, 1/2/08]




o      In 2007, McCain said the Bhutto assassination would "enhance" his
foreign policy credentials. McCain said "My theme has been throughout this
campaign that I'm the one with the experience, the knowledge and the
judgment. So perhaps it may serve to enhance those credentials to make
people understand that I've been to Pakistan, I know Musharraf, I can pick
up the phone and call him. I knew Benazir Bhutto." [Associated Press,
12/28/07]




o      In 2004, McCain commented on the October Bin Laden Tape: "I Think
It's Very Helpful To President Bush." McCain said, "I think it's very
helpful to President Bush.  It focuses America's attention on the war on
terrorism. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but I think it does
have an effect." [Associated Press, 10/30/04]




.         Republicans consistently use fear to scare voters.  Republicans
from President Bush to Karl Rove to Rudy Giuliani have used terrorism and
fear to try to scare voters to their side. See the attached document for
more information.
