Our Meeting

Thanks for taking the time for the meeting this week with our team and Mark. We are incredibly excited about the prospects of a deal here. 

We are waiting to get the valuation and model data from EMC so we can analyze and discuss a constructive strategy for our investment. 

I am in the office all day tomorrow of you would like to follow up but I will keep you posted as soon as we have some concrete info. 

If we don't speak before the weekend, enjoy your weekend and the SuperBowl. 

Best,

Stephen.
