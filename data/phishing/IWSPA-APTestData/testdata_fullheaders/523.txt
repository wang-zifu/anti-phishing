Thank You and a New Beginning (Sony Corp Hide Nagata)

Hello.  This is Hide Nagata of Sony Corp.  

I would like to inform you that I will be relocating to Los Angeles and work in the Sony Pictures Home Entertainment organization (Global Commercial Planning) from August 1.  The last six years has truly been an extraordinary experience for me.  I deeply appreciate all the support those of you involved in the entertainment business have provided to me performing my role at HQ Corporate Planning & Control.  The more I had a chance to associate with each of you, the more passionate I became about your business and the more I felt the need for me to inform/explain your business to others in Tokyo.  Not only were the discussion about various strategic/financial issues with each of you were interesting, I enjoyed watching your movies, TV programs, and TV channels or listening/reading your music/lyrics.  It was a great feeling for me to explain to my three daughters that I am working with companies who had found One Direction or created 1D movie. Obviously, my daughters started to show more respect afterwards and probably watched X Factor (or Idol) more than any other young girls in Tokyo under the influence of their father.  I cannot thank you enough even from my family happiness perspective.  

Starting today, I will be engaging in a very different role compared to what I had been doing.  Similar to six years ago I assume there will be various challenges but I am grateful and excited about the opportunity and will do all my best so that I can contribute to Sony's entertainment business.  While my new role may not necessarily have a direct business relationship with most of you, I hope I can keep contact and of course if there is anything I can help please do let me know.  

For your information, I would also like to change my shop beginning today.  "Nagata-san" has closed and "Better Call Hide" has opened!  I hope for your understanding. 

Again, thank you very much for everything.  Yoshi Saito, who had been working in Sony Global Treasury Services America, is my successor.  I hope you will provide your continued support to him and Sony HQ.  I look forward to meeting you sometime in the future and wish you all the best.
