Comic-Con: McConaughey & Nolan Debut, Batman 75, Dark Horses’s 8 Trailblazers, Catching The Lucy/Thor Wave, Jacki Weaver Q&A




SSN ORIGINALS




IGN on SSN: McConaughey and Nolan Make Their Comic-Con Debuts!

Paramount’s Comic-Con panel in Hall H was packed with surprises on Thursday, most notably a special presentation of Interstellar where Christopher Nolan himself and star Matthew McConaughey made their Comic-Con debuts. Not surprisingly, McConaughey remained tight-lipped on the plot of Interstellar, but naturally praised Nolan’s work: “It’s his most ambitious film. You’ll know when you see it.”  The new trailer is included in the report (SSN)



IGN on SSN: Batman 75: Legends of the Dark Knight Panel Recap

Today’s Batman 75: Legends of the Dark Knight panel featured Batman comic makers Frank Miller, Jim Lee, Geoff Johns, Neal Adams, and Denny O’Neil, who all got a huge round of applause as they took the stage with no introduction. John Cunningham moderated the panel, starting by asking why Batman is so popular right now between comics, video games, movies, and TV. (SSN)



Comic-Con: How Dark Horse Is Empowering Creators - Their 8 Most Innovative Comics

Dark Horse continues its mission to empower the best creators to do their best work, an M.O. that’s working out pretty well for companies like Netflix (who earned 31 Emmy nominations this year) who trust their talent and wind up with stronger properties because of it. SSN takes a look at a few Dark Horse titles that prove the notion that trusting creators yields innovative work, starting here (SSN)



Catch the Lucy/Thor Wave & Gender Switch These 6 Action Films in Dev Now

SSN ponders the state of the industry and female stars’ place in it, especially as Lucy  is expected to beat the male-led actioner Hercules. That Scarlett Johansson is at the center of the discussion raises two questions—why is she the only one?, and why is almost everyone else afraid to make movies built around women? SSN’s looks at some projects in active development that, judging by their log line, could easily switch lead genders, Salt-style, here. (SSN)



Spotlight: Magic In the Moonlight’s Jacki Weaver on Woody Allen vs. David O. Russell

SSN spoke to two-time Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver about landing her first role in a Woody Allen film, what it was like to shoot in the south of France, and how Allen compares to David. O Russell. (SSN)
