Support New Progressive IdeasOctober 29, 2015 

Dear John,

On Sunday, The Washington Post published a piece I wrote on the new ALICE class (<<link>>) -- Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. These Americans have a unique set of experiences and outlook that make them distinct from both the poor and the middle class from which they have been cleaved. This kind of analysis -- and the agenda of asset building that comes with it -- is what we do at Democracy.

From the middle class to the Middle East, Democracy is the place where new thinking gets developed and new ideas get launched. In just our most recent issue (<<link>>), we analyzed the crisis in the Republican Party, America's relationship with Russia, the state of anti-Semitism, the future of organized labor, and new policies around parenting. Whether it is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, middle-out economics, or many other solutions and innovations from our pages, we don't just put forward ideas, we work to get them attention and traction. As Senator Elizabeth Warren recently said, "ideas are like seeds" and the role of Democracy is to create a "place for an idea to take hold, a place where others could add to it and make it grow."

But we can only do that work with your help. Our publication is almost completely funded by the contributions of our readers. If you're someone who believes that ideas matter, will you make a tax-deductible donation today? (<<link>>)

This year, Democracy has had more readers than ever before. From Chris Hayes on MSNBC to Ross Douthat in The New York Times, we've been cited as a must-read across the political spectrum. But while our annual budget is small, we can't continue our mission without your help. Thank you for considering a donation -- of any size -- so that the work we do to create progressive ideas can survive and thrive. (<<link>>)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While you're at it, please consider subscribing to our print edition (<<link>>) and giving the gift of Democracy (<<link>>) to a friend or loved one this holiday season. It makes a great Christmas stocking stuffer -- or discussion topic for this year's Thanksgiving/Hanukkah celebrations.

We appreciate your support.

Best,

Andrei Cherny

President, Democracy
