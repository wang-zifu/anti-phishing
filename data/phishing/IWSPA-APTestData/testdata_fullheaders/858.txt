*         CNN interview with HRC was great. She said she does not believe Trump is qualified to be president.

*         Trump offered up SCOTUS justices with extreme positions.

*         We want to be careful not to say Trump is flip flopping on issues. Don't acknowledge Trump is changing positions. He's not changing positions-he is changing tone. His positions remain disturbing. Minimum wage is an example of this.

*         On Nevada: it's important for our party to come together. HRC mathematically is going to be the nominee.
