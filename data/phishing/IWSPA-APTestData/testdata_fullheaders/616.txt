Michael,

I understand from Amy and Ari there's a minor kerfuffle brewing with Steve Jobs. I wanted to let you know that I'm sensitive to your concerns and that there's nothing that can't be easily solved. (And that Michael Moritz is, again, an of-screen character, is a bizarre coincidence and of course I'll change his name if that makes you more comfortable but I get that there are other issues as well.) I'm grateful in the extreme that you tapped me for the screenplay and signed off on such a risky and uncommon structure and all I want is for you and Amy to be beaming with pride at the premiere.Â 

Best,

Aaron
