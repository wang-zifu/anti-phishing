Team =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99ll let the press staff elaborate, but the current 
plan is to give
Dorothy to some select IA and NH news outlets tomorrow evening.  Once those
stories run, the campaign will confirm the spot to the Beltway press and
then release them both Dorothy and Families Strong on Monday am.  Did I get
that right press team?

Here are some draft background points =E2=80=93 just for Dorothy =E2=80=93 
will need a new
batch for Sunday am, but please weigh in with thoughts edits?

*Internal Talking Points =E2=80=93 Ad Launch =E2=80=9CDorothy=E2=80=9D *For
 Sunday, Aug 2 2015 

=C2=B7         This week, the Clinton campaign will begin taking its case
directly to the people of Iowa and New Hampshire with its first TV ad of
the campaign.

=C2=B7         The .60 second ad, titled, =E2=80=9CDorothy=E2=80=9D, featur
es Hillary Clinton
talking about the woman who motivated her to dedicate her life to fighting
for everyday families =E2=80=93 and that=E2=80=99s her mother Dorothy.  Hil
lary=E2=80=99s mom had a
very difficult childhood, but she taught Hillary that it=E2=80=99s not abou
t what
life throws at you =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s about what you do with it.  Hilla
ry has always
been a champion for people who got knocked down but refused to get knocked
out.

=C2=B7         We felt it was important to begin communicating directly to
voters in August because it=E2=80=99s likely to be the last time that the a
irwaves
in Iowa and New Hampshire aren=E2=80=99t totally cluttered with ads by Repu
blican
candidates and their Super PACs.  It=E2=80=99s a unique window for Hillary 
Clinton
to cut through and take her message to voters.

=C2=B7         The ad will air in Iowa and New Hampshire and tomorrow (Mond
ay),
we=E2=80=99ll be placing a six-figure buy in each state.   (If asked: In Io
wa, it
will air in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. In NH, it will air on WMUR in
Manchester, Boston cable TV and in the Burlington market).

*Are you airing TV ads because of bad poll numbers?*Since day one, this
campaign has been about taking Hillary=E2=80=99s message of being a fighter
 for
families directly to the people of Iowa/New Hampshire.  And because the
Republican Super PACs haven=E2=80=99t totally clogged the airwaves yet, we 
believe
this is a good time for that message to cut through. Plus, the latest round
of polling =E2=80=93 both in the primary and the general =E2=80=93 showed H
RC to be in very
strong position, leading all Republican candidates.

*Is this a soft touchy feely ad designed to deal with her trust
domain.com?*Everyday
families in America know they can count on Hillary Clinton to fight for
them, and this ad is about taking that message directly to the people of
Iowa/New Hampshire.

*How long will the ad air for? *We=E2=80=99re not going to comment on the l
ength of
the buy or the strategy of future ad buys.

*This ad clearly seems to be targeting women =E2=80=93 is that true?*

This ad is about Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s values and why she dedicated her
 life to
fighting for families. And when Hillary talks about her mother on the
campaign trail, the men in the crowds are nodding their heads right along
with the women. It=E2=80=99s about fighting for families =E2=80=93 and gett
ing back up
again after you=E2=80=99ve been knocked down.

*How much are you spending?*It=E2=80=99s a six-figure buy and covers the la
rgest
media markets in both states.
