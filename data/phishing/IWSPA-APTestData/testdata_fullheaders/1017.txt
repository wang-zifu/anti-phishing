Mr. user,

I attended Maret School with your son Gabe (although I graduated a year ahe
ad of him).  I apologize for this email out of the blue, but hoped you migh
t be willing to chat with me (or connect me with someone who can) about pot
entially getting involved with the Hillary Clinton 2015 campaign.   A few b
rief points regarding my background and experience are set forth below.  A 
copy of my resume is also attached hereto.

-          Six years of experience as a litigator, specializing in white co
llar criminal and regulatory matters, including actions involving the healt
h care and financial services industry.

-          Attorney volunteer with Election Protection.

-          Recognized by New York Legal Services as a "Top 30 Pro Bono Atto
rney" for 2015 for my work on behalf of veterans.

-          Volunteer for Hillary Clinton's campaign in Atlanta, GA where I 
helped run a number of events with Ethan Rosenzweig.

-          Graduated from Vanderbilt University with a degree in Political 
Science.

-          Worked as a volunteer on John Edwards' campaign in Raleigh, NC.

-          Interned at the Glover Park Group where I worked with Chip Smith
, Michael Feldman, Carter Eskew, and Joe Lockhart.

-          Worked with Roy Neel as a volunteer on Al Gore's campaign in Nas
hville, TN.

I am hardworking, passionate, and a quick study.  I am strong writer, resea
rcher, and advocate.  I am a seasoned Vamoose passenger.  I already live in
 Brooklyn.  Most importantly, I believe that Hillary Clinton is without que
stion the best candidate to serve as President.  I want to be a part of thi
s historic campaign and I believe I can make a meaningful impact.

If you have time, I would love to discuss my qualifications and potential o
pportunities with you further.

Thanks in advance,

Andrew Robbins
