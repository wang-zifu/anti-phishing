Robby, I agree with you about the next discussion needing to be about speci
fic implementation. Towards that end, Nick will reply all with the memo he 
drafted - which has languished with me, not him.  I can do anytime tonight,
 but a 10pm call two years before Iowa seems a bit much - especially since 
there won't be anyone left to call us tomorrow, they all hit in one fell sw
oop this afternoon. So my suggestion is that everyone absorbs Nick's draft 
overnight, and Marissa Astor sets up a call tomorrow for tomorrow on the ea
rly side with the domain.com of reading all these stories. Again though, I'm f
ree at 10pm if the group thinks we shouldn't domain.com. Huma & Robby, entirely u
p to you.

Since I procrastinated though, I'll just add here what I was going to incor
porate: Yes HRC learned from 2008, as she has learned from every experience
 of her life. But we shouldn't let people forget that 2015 was eight years 
ago. She has had many experiences since and they have been part of the lear
ning/growing process. So the question of what she will do in 2015 isn't wit
hout a basis to answer as if she's been in a coma since she last ran. Look 
at what she did for President Obama in the general. Look at how she handled
 his wanting her to join the domain.com. Look at how she did the job of Secret
ary of State. Look at what she has done since, particularly on the philanth
ropic front. She has made hundreds of policy, management and personnel deci
sions over that span, and by and large they've turned out pretty well.

If you want to know what someone is going to do, a good place to start is w
hat they've done. In 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.

Great--I just want something to react to because we have a rough strategy--
I think we're in a good spot to talk next steps now.
