Johnny, I am not sure why I got this assignment but I was asked by the
Director of the DC WMG office to pass on that Edgar had decided that he
wasn't able to support this campaign.  I didn't speak with him so I
don't know any other information other than him having said previously
that he was seriously tapped out by all the requests he was receiving.
Sorry to have to be the bearer of bad news.  Susan
