The dagger, The Oscars & a letter to the President of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences

From the desk of CB McCarty




March 3, 2015 




Ms. Cheryl Boone Isaacs

President

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences




Dear Ms. Isaacs,




Was it just me or did you also see the deftly handled dagger that Ellen DeGeneres was wielding toward the professionals of the motion picture industry last night? And it wasn’t just actors who were handily sliced to pieces. It was everyone who works in the motion picture industry. 




To quote Ms. DeGeneres “movies are not the most important thing in the world….the most important thing in life is love and family and if people don’t have those things they get into show business”. Or her quip that over 1400 films had been made by those in attendance but they’d gone “to a total of six years of college” (singling out Amy Adams who hadn’t gone to college) and the slice at Bruce Dern (and everyone in attendance) whose grandfather was the governor of Utah, his uncle a Pulitzer Prize winning poet and his godmother was Eleanor Roosevelt and to quote Ms. Degeneres “and here you are tonight…what went wrong?”




What went wrong was putting a host who ruthlessly denigrated the integrity of the brilliant and hard working professionals of the motion picture industry. And I don’t think it was the intention of the men and women who put on the first Academy Awards in the Blossom Room of the Roosevelt Hotel in 1929 to rip at the heart of their chosen profession. 




With a beautiful tribute to The Wizard of Oz I guess it was Ms. DeGeneres’ intention to pull the curtain back on the Wizards of the motion picture industry. And, yes it’s true, that the Wizard of Oz was ‘just a man’ but he was also the one who brought magic and mystery to Emerald City and, ultimately, granted wishes by giving Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal, the Tin Man a heart-shaped pocket watch and offered to get Dorthy home in his hot air balloon. 




Congratulations on the great job your doing at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences but how about some writers and a host next year who frankly gives a damn about the professionals of the motion picture industry.




Sincerely,




CB 'Chris'  McCarty
