John -
p. We only have 25 days left. Twenty-five days to knock on doors, change mi
nds, and make our case to Angelenos across the city. =C2=A0

That's why today, we are launching our first television ad of the campaign.
 I wanted you, one of my biggest supporters, to see it before it goes on ai
r.=C2=A0

"Click here to watch our new ad, and once you do, consider contributing $10
 to keep it on the air.

":<<link>>

I'm running for Mayor because identifying problems is easy; solving them is
 hard. I've been working hard in my district to revitalize neighborhoods an
d create jobs.=C2=A0

We need to do the basics better. That means answering phones, filling potho
les, and picking up trash. Because doing the basics right makes life better
 for families and makes growth possible.=C2=A0

We can't do that without your support. Click here to watch our new ad and c
ontribute $10 to keep it on the air. <<<link>>

ing, or sharing our ad on Facebook. Every little bit helps move Los Angeles
 forward.=C2=A0

Thank you,
Eric=C2=A0
