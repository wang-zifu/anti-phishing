Hi everyone,

Attached is the script for a cut of Spanish-language commentary on violence
 inspired by Donald Trump=92s campaign. This is (I believe) going straight 
to Reuters for a specific article.

I believe User has already signed off, but if anyone from comms or research
 has any questions please let me know! Thank you.
