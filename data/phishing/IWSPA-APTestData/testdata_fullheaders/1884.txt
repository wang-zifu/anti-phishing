Midsummer is a sacred time

Join our celebration, tomorrow in DTLA

James Hood Presents
A Midsummer Ceremony
Friday 20 June now with TWO shows
We have very few tickets left here

All ages festival 3pm-8pm
Second show 9pm-late

After month of planning we are excited to invite you to join us for a Midsummer Ceremony, in downtown Los Angeles. James Hood, multi instrumentalist and hang player has gathered together a band of entertainers to stimulate your every sense over an enchanted evening.

Taking place in The Vortex, a 360 degree dome, the evening will include a special live performance of "Ceremony" by James Hood with stunning immersive visuals featuring original art work by Tatiana Plakhova for Complexity Graphics and other celestial sounds, hypnotronic music , performance and food and drink.

The event is set to be a sensual happening from start to finish, definitely an evening to remember.

With drinks from Moonjuice Silverlake and food from Fred 62 of Los Feliz.

We would love to see our guests dressed as Gods and Goddesses wearing all white to enjoy the event. But we want everyone to feel comfortable so the dress code is not enforced.
