John -- trust me when I say this:

John Foust can deliver a major upset to the GOP and turn Northern Virginia 
"blue."

But he needs you with him right now. Polls show him deadlocked with 
Barbara Comstock, but his record is being smeared 24 hours a day on 
Virginia T.V.

So, I'm asking. Can you pitch in for John before tonight's fundraising so 
he has the resources to set the record straight?

Some of John's strong supporters have agreed to match dollar for dollar 
any funds raised from this email.
