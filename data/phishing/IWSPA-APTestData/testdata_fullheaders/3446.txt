Plus Erik who has negotiated our debates. I believe we left that to the net
works. If you get a little more info from him on what kind of story he's wo
rking on we can decide if it's worth giving him any insight.

Subject: question

I have a question I am hoping someone there can help me with on background,
 attributable to a "Democratic official" or whatever terms we negotiate.

Regarding the primary election debates, does anyone there know definitively
 whether the presidential campaigns negotiate the share of questions they w
ill receive (40% of the questions asked, 50%, etc.), or is that something t
he network has license to decide? During the general election debate, I'm t
old, an equal number of questions is a negotiated point.  But how does it w
ork for the primary?

Thanks much for any guidance.
