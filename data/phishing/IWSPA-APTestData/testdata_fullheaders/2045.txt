Thank You for Making a Difference




 the OneVoice Newsletter




Crowdrise logo

Thanks to you, OneVoice raised nearly $320,000 through the Skoll Foundation’s Social Entrepreneurs Challenge—over four times more than we’ve ever before raised online! You and hundreds of other supporters contributed an incredible $175,000 in the last 24 hours alone.



This extraordinary generosity has qualified us for a $40,000 prize, and we will share an additional $1 million with the 56 inspired and innovative organizations with whom we competed and who together raised $2.4 million for causes benefiting people across the globe.    



Events of recent weeks have made the challenges to ending the conflict all too clear, but it is precisely when faith in the two-state solution is at a low that OneVoice’s mission is most critical. The only way to rise above the obstacles to peace is for us to become more ambitious and bolder in our work, and thanks to your commitment, that is precisely what we are doing. 

All the money raised on Crowdrise will go toward activities that empower and energize Israelis and Palestinians to end the occupation and the conflict by making the two-state solution a reality. Thank you for standing with us as we support a better future for both sides.

*Make sure to follow us on Facebook and Twitter for updates and news as OneVoice re-energizes its efforts for #2StatesNOW.*
