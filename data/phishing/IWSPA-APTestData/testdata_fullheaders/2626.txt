FW: Building For Tomorrow - Talking Points and Q&A

Does this work for you guys or should we tweak… (and yes, am using you as my “focus group” before wider dissemination)?

Subject: Building For Tomorrow - Talking Points and Q&A




In preparation for our employee notifications, we prepared two documents to assist you with discussing the upcoming transition with your teams. The attached talking points are designed to be delivered orally while the Q&A may be helpful in answering potential employee questions.   I understand and appreciate you may need to tailor them to your division and am happy to work with you to domain.com them accordingly.  




As we discussed last week, we are not going to proactively communicate with reporters.  I’ve pasted below our reactive holding statement.  Please feel free to refer calls to me.




 “We are continuously evolving the business to make SPE more efficient and competitive.” 




Please let me know if you have any questions.




Thanks,




Charlie
