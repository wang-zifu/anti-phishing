Friend,

Running for office in the Super PAC era is a lot like
playing 1 on 1 basketball -- against an entire Final Four
team.

I'm not just running against Ken Cuccinelli. I'm running
against Ken Cuccinelli, Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers, AND
anyone else who decides to throw on a jersey, form a Super
PAC, and spend unlimited amounts of money to try and buy
this election.

If we fall behind in this game, they might be able to spend
their way to victory.

Sunday's end of quarter fundraising deadline is fast
approaching and I'm just $68,445 away from my goal -- and from
raising the kind of money we need to stay in it and win it.

Will you donate $5 right now to help me get there?

I set a big goal for this quarter because just matching
Cuccinelli's fundraising numbers won't be enough. It's not
just us vs. him, it's us vs. him and his deep bench of Super
PAC ringers.

If we're going to be heard above the TV ads their millions
will buy (and that kind of money buys a lot of ads), we need
to outraise him.

Fortunately, I've got people like you on my team -- folks
who'll talk directly to their neighbors about what's at
stake for all of us in this election. Folks who'll support
me with a contribution when I let you know it's really
important.

This is one of those times.

Let's show Ken Cuccinelli -- and all the outside groups lined
up to buy this election for him -- that we won't be scared
away from this fight.

Please donate $5 to help me raise $100,000 before midnight
Sunday:

This isn't an even fight, but having you on my side makes it
feel a whole lot fairer,

Terry
