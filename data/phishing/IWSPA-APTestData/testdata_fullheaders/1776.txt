What's the catch?

Dear John=2C

If there is one question we get about Aspiration from customers=2C reporte
rs=2C and even an occasional family member=2C it is this: =E2=80=9CWhat=E2
=80=99s the catch?=E2=80=9D

How can the Aspiration domain.com Account offer interest rates up to 100 times
 more than Big Banks without monthly fees or any ATM fees? How come we are
 able to offer our mutual funds at only a $500 minimum investment? And how
 can we really let our customers pay what they think is fair and then give
 10% of our revenue to charity?

The answer is that there=E2=80=99s no catch. There=E2=80=99s no secret beh
ind what we do. Aspiration=E2=80=99s mission is to always put our customer
s first =E2=80=93 and to be second to none when it comes to that commitmen
t. Many banks and investment firms say this=2C but it is another thing to
 live it.

We offer this level of service because that=E2=80=99s what we prioritize.
 There is no Aspiration corporate jet. Our executive lunchroom is the vend
ing machine downstairs or Chipotle across the street. And well over 90% of
 our investment customers are happy to choose to pay us because they are h
appy with the job we=E2=80=99re doing for them.

Will you take this opportunity to join the thousands of others who have op
ened an Aspiration investment account or domain.com checking/savings account?

Aspiration was born with very different DNA than Big Banks and other finan
cial institutions. But the sad part is that major banks and investment fir
ms could have been doing the same.

When banks are making over $150 billion in profits every year=2C there=E2
=80=99s no reason they need to clobber their customers with fees and pay b
asically zero in interest. Investment firms can afford to work for the mid
dle class and not just millionaires. And one day=2C Wall Street will under
stand that you can trust people if you act in ways worthy of their trust.

Maybe then=2C people will stop asking us=2C =E2=80=9CWhat=E2=80=99s the ca
tch?=E2=80=9D And they=E2=80=99ll ask the rest of the financial industry
=2C =E2=80=9CWhen will you catch up?=E2=80=9D

Let=E2=80=99s do this!

P.S. If you=E2=80=99ve hesitated to open an Aspiration account previously
=2C now=E2=80=99s the time to join thousands of others who are becoming pa
rt of one of America=E2=80=99s fastest growing online investment firms. (h
