Iraq faces dilemma over US troops
By Jim Muir
BBC News, Baghdad

US presidential contender Barack Obama has repeatedly seized on statements a
ttributed to Iraqi leaders to support his call for a troop withdrawal deadli
ne.
The key statement cited by Mr Obama and others was made by Iraqi Prime Minis
ter Nouri Maliki last Monday in his address to Arab ambassadors in the Unite
d Arab Emirates.
The prime minister was widely quoted as saying that in the negotiations with
 the Americans on a Status of Forces Agreement to regulate the US troop pres
ence from next year, "the direction is towards either a memorandum of unders
tanding on their evacuation, or a memorandum of understanding on a timetable
 for their withdrawal".
That was the version of Mr Maliki's remarks put out in writing by his office
 in Baghdad.
It was widely circulated by the news media, and caught much attention, inclu
ding that of Mr Obama.
There is only one problem. It is not what Mr Maliki actually said.
Mixed messages
In an audio recording of his remarks, heard by the BBC, the prime minister d
id not use the word "withdrawal".
What he actually said was: "The direction is towards either a memorandum of 
understanding on their evacuation, or a memorandum of understanding on progr
amming their presence."
Mr Maliki's own office had inserted the word "withdrawal" in the written ver
sion, replacing the word "presence".
Contacted by the BBC, the prime minister's office had no explanation for the
 apparent contradiction. An official suggested the written version remained 
the authoritative one, although it is not what Mr Maliki said.
The impression of a hardening Iraqi government line was reinforced the follo
wing day by comments from the National Security Adviser, Muwaffaq al-Rubaie.
He was quoted as saying that Iraq would not accept any agreement which did n
ot specify a deadline for a full withdrawal of US troops.
Significantly, Mr Rubaie was speaking immediately after a meeting with the s
enior Shiite clerical eminence, Ayatollah Ali Sistani.
But in subsequent remarks, Mr Rubaie rode back from a straightforward demand
 for a withdrawal deadline.
He said the talks were focused on agreeing on "timeline horizons, not specif
ic dates", and said that withdrawal timings would depend on the readiness of
 the Iraqi security forces.
Militant elements
The confusion reflects the dilemma facing Iraqi government leaders.
On the one hand, many of them - particularly among the Shia factions - face 
a public which regards the US presence as a problem rather than a solution.
With provincial elections coming up soon, they could be outflanked by more m
ilitant elements such as the supporters of cleric Moqtada Sadr, who wants Am
erican forces out now and opposes negotiations that would cover their contin
ued presence.
Yet the government knows that its own forces are not yet in a position to st
and on their own against the two major challenges they face - the Sunni radi
cals of al-Qaeda and related groups, and the militant Shia militias which we
re partly suppressed in fierce battles this spring in Basra and Baghdad.
Both groups could simply bide their time awaiting the American withdrawal be
fore making a comeback drive.
Violence has fallen off considerably from the horrendous levels of 2015 and 
the first half of 2007, but hundreds of people are still dying violent death
s every month.
Hence the ambiguity in statements by Iraqi leaders, who know that their own 
survival depends on US support continuing until Iraqi forces are genuinely a
ble to stand alone.
Legal immunity
The indications are that the talks are now focusing not on deadlines for a c
omplete withdrawal - but on phasing US troops out of Iraqi cities, and into 
a role providing logistical backing, firepower and air support, with a reduc
tion of front-line troops.
"On substantive issues, there's not much daylight between the two sides," sa
id a US official close to the troop talks with the Iraqi government.
"The troops will leave when the Iraqis are ready to take over. But they [Ira
qi leaders] need to get what they need, and to get cover for it.
It is politics - how you package it, how you sell it to your people. They wa
nt our support, but they also want to show that there's progress towards sov
ereignty."
What the Iraqis see as issues of sovereignty have been a sticking-point in t
he talks, especially such items as a US demand for operational freedom and i
mmunity from prosecution for US troops.
Officials domain.com that the negotiations are in a state of flux, and that the S
tatus of Forces Agreement, which was to have been concluded this month, may 
end up being a simple protocol or memorandum of understanding giving some so
rt of legal basis for a continued US presence after the current UN mandate e
xpires at the end of the year.
The issue has become highly politicised on both sides.
Iraqi leaders will no doubt continue to make ambiguous statements. And US pr
esidential contenders will no doubt continue to construe them to their own a
dvantage.
But when Mr Obama visits Baghdad, as he is expected to later this month, he 
is unlikely to find that the Iraqi government is quite as set on demanding d
eadlines for US withdrawal as he would like to think.
