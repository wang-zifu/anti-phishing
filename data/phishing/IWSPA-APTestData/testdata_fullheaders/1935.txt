Edits... Maybe there's a better way of doing the quote? Something snappier?

SL: Hey Ted, let us save you some time with that Fiorina vetting

Insert laundry list of fuckups and then the quote.

=93Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers, out sourced American jobs, destro
yed HP's stock value and took a $42 million golden parachute upon being fir
ed. If a record like that passes Ted Cruz's vetting operation, he has worse
 judgment than we thought."

And I actually think it quote should come from a woman but that's not my ca
ll.
