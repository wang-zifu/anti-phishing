Subject: Sandler Education think tank startup info

FYI earlier today I met with the two folk from the Sandler's new education 
think tank. They are moving rapidly, having already signed a lease on space
 at Dupont Circle and in the Stanford Research Center, hired two out of the
 15 anticipated staff in DC and three of the anticipated six in California,
 and are now looking for the best systems (tech, pubs, legal, finance) to r
oll into. I didn't probe too much but their questions indicate that they ar
e considering how to ramp up quickly in hiring but debating the kind of bac
k-end hires they need to make (legal, HR, finance, tech) either in house or
 contracted.

Final Sandler slides coming shortly

Subject: RE: Slides + script for Monday

Hi Heather-I have some changes to the competition matrix from John that I'l
l start typing up now in tracked changes.  John would like to know why we c
an't fit the longer substance in the slide presentation (or put more correc
tly, why did we shorten it for the slide presentation?).

I believe we're still waiting on #18, the 2015 objectives, is that correct?

Also, he asks if we could number the slides?

Thank you!  Here at 202-741-6386 if you need us,
Eryn

Hello John,

Here's the slides and a script I put together to go with them. The last sli
des got cut off - our 2015 objectives, the budget, and the Appendix table o
f contents, but those are both in the Appendix materials I just sent you an
d we'll fix in the next iteration.

The script has questions about two slides that emphasize the point, but are
 a bit redundant and we're wondering if we should cut them for space.

Thanks,
HMB
