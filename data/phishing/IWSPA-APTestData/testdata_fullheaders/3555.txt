*Message A*: When it comes to her use of personal email for official
business, Hillary Clinton has said she made a mistake and if she could do
it again, she=E2=80=99d do it differently. And while Hillary Clinton follow
ed the
rules that were in place at the time, she regrets the confusion and
distraction this has created. But the fact remains that Clinton never sent
classified emails from a personal account, and to be transparent, she has
turned over 55,000 pages of emails to be made public and gave her personal
server to government officials. But she now believes it=E2=80=99s important
 to
focus her attention on what matters most to Americans and their families 
=E2=80=93
like the economy and health care costs.

*Message B*: When it comes to the use of personal email for official
business, Hillary Clinton has said that she followed the rules that were in
place at the time and, in fact, her email was set up the same way as past
Secretaries of State like Colin Powell. In hindsight, she says she would
have done things differently, but the fact remain that Clinton never sent
classified emails from a personal account. And, to be transparent, she has
turned over 55,000 pages of emails to be made public and gave her server to
government officials. But she now believes it=E2=80=99s important to focus 
her
attention on what matters most to Americans and their families =E2=80=93 li
ke the
economy and health care costs.

*Message C*: When it comes to the use of her personal email address for
official business, Hillary Clinton now says she should have done it
differently. She says that just like the vast majority of State Department
employees, she should have maintained both a personal and an official email
account. But to be transparent, she=E2=80=99s turned over 55,000 pages of e
mails
for official review =E2=80=93 including more than a thousand personal email
s that
were returned to her. She says she=E2=80=99s confident that those now revie
wing her
emails will confirm that there were no classified emails sent from or
received by her personal account. And while that process concludes, she=E2
=80=99s
going to focus her attention on what matters most to Americans and their
families =E2=80=93 like strengthening the economy and reducing healthcare c
osts.
