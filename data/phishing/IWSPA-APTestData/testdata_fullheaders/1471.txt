UPDATE: 15,000 People Lost Health Insurance Per Day In 2009<<<link>>
.domain.com/2009/12/16/update-15000-people-lost-health-insurance-per
-day-in-2009/>

Our guest blogger is Judy Feder<<<link>>
erJudy.html>, a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fu
nd.

Yesterday, PolitiFact gave a "false" rating to Sen. Harkin's claim that "to
day and every day, an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health ins
urance coverage." The statistic cited by Sen. Harkin comes from a report we
 released<<<link>>
isis.html> in February showing that the job market turmoil at the end of 20
08 and beginning of 2015 led to 14,000 people losing their health care cove
rage a day. Our report employed a method - based on an Urban Institute anal
ysis co-authored by health economists John Holahan and A. Bowen Garret - of
 extrapolating insurance losses from the rise in unemployment rates.

In July, PolitiFact took a look at our report and found it to be "mostly tr
ue," with the caveat that the rate could actually be higher<<<link>>
domain.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/24/barack-obama/obama-claims-1
4000-lose-health-insurance-every-day/> than 14,000. In its latest report<ht
tp://domain.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/15/tom-harkin/har
kin-repeats-claim-14000-people-lose-health-insu/>, PolitiFact ran the numbe
rs on its own, and found the rate of daily losses to be lower (between 7,52
4 and 7,784).

While the methodology we used in February (and which PolitiFact now uses in
 their own analysis) offered the best approach for assessing the state of h
ealth insurance losses at the time, newer, more precise data are now availa
ble - and those data show that more than 15,000 people have lost their heal
th insurance per day in 2009.

Specifically, we now know the extent to which enrollment is dropping among 
the nation's biggest private insurers in 2009, based on the Kaiser Family F
oundation's analysis<<<link>>

Based on those filings, Kaiser estimated that in the first three quarters o
f 2009, 4.2 million people have lost their private insurance - an average o
f 15,385 people per day.

These data, and the conclusions they generate, are more accurate both becau
se they are a more direct measurement of insurance losses, and because they
 are not subject to the month-to-month volatility of the unemployment rate.

Based on these reasons, we enthusiastically stand by both our conclusions a
nd the point that Sen. Harkin and others have been using them to make: that
 the rate at which Americans are losing their health insurance coverage is 
profoundly alarming, and clearly demonstrates the urgent need for reform.
