	Dear Leah,




	We are starting an outreach program at Stephen Wise Temple for our members in college, so we can stay in touch and be a community of support to our collegians, who are balancing college activities, academic rigor, and living away from the comforts of home. 




	We would like to send your child a Hanukkah gift (Who doesn’t like a Starbucks gift card?) to let them know that we care and are here for them. Having seen many of our college-age members from preschool to b’nai mitzvah and beyond, we want to continue to recognize their achievements and the milestones in their lives. We are so proud of our young adults and we want them to know this! 




	Please take just a couple minutes to fill out this quick-form, providing contact information and year of graduation. We look forward to deepening our relationship with all of our members, at all ages and stages. Click here to access the form.




	And if you find yourself with some extra time while your child is away at school, we have some excellent evening programs scheduled this year. Feel free to contact us about programs or consult user@domain.com




	Warmly, 

	Rabbis Herscher, Woznica, Stern, Anderson, Zweiback, and Cantor Lam
