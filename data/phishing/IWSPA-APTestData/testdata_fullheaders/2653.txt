Dear amybernieanthony,

Dear Amy,

I have tried to get in contact with you a few times by telephone but haven't had any luck. Unfortunately the set that you ordered is no longer in stock. I have tried my best to try and get it in from our suppliers but to my disappointment I haven't managed to get hold of one. I would be happy to offer you another item from our eBay store with a value of up to £16, or otherwise I will be happy to refund the order in full.

I am very sorry for the inconvenience.

Best regards,
Sales Team
