Bobbie --

Leah has been so flexible in setting a date, and I am a bit embarrassed to be coming back again.

Our scheduled March 31 conversation with Paul Williams has to be rescheduled because he will be in Europe for a SESAC meeting.  Is there any chance Leah could move to the Monday, March 31 date, allowing us to move Paul to late April?

I apologize for the shifting schedule.  I hope it will work for Leah.

Thanks,

Steve
