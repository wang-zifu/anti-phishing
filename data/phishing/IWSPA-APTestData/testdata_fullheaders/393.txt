Happy New Year, Neera.  I was delighted to hear from you and appreciate
your taking the time to speak for Hillary and to write to me.  You are the
only "surrogate" out of dozens who as ever thanked me!  You must have been
brought up extremely well. If you have any influence over Hillary's
campaign now, I wish that you would urge her to cut the attacks on Bernie.
Her description of his single payer plan isn't accurate and makes her look
very much on the defensive.  She will always be the best qualified
candidate for president whom we have ever had, and she doesn't need to
resort to petty attacks.  Just stick with her excellent and
well-thought-out policy proposals!
Sincerely,
Katie
