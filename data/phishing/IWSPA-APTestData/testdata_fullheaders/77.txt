SL: Senate Judiciary Clock Is Ticking

It's been 43 days of Republican obstruction since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, meaning that we have passed the average amount of time it takes the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on a nominee to the Supreme Court - and the Senate Republicans are still holding out for Donald Trump.

The Constitution is clear: it's the President's job to nominate Supreme Court justices, and it's the Senate's job to give the nominee a fair consideration with a hearing and vote. Not in our modern political system has it taken this long to fulfill a Supreme Court vacancy, let alone refuse to give the nominee a fair hearing a vote.

And yet, some Republican lawmakers are still refusing to acknowledge Trump<<<link>>> as the standard baron for the Republican party and the one they are waiting for to nominate a Supreme Court justice.

Republicans have chosen to play politics rather than do their jobs and fulfill the most basic constitutional requirements. Americans couldn't be clearer: stop the obstruction and do your job.
