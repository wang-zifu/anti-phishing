Good afternoon, Miss Weil.

I am just returning to the office today and am wondering if the meeting with you and Joe Waz has been scheduled.  If not, I would like to go ahead and schedule it.  Please let me know your availability between now and June 9th.  After that, Joe will be leaving for DC, returning to LA after the 26th.

Warm regards,

Maria​​​​​
