Hello All,
Unfortunately we weren't able to send a tracker to this event. But good
news: we were able to capture the event via online-streaming video. Below
are the notes from that effort.

Big Highlights*

   - Goes into depth about Biden comments-- lays out the 5 "crisis"
   scenarios we might face, based on Obama's foreign policy plans
      - 1- meeting with world's worst dictators (e.g. Iranian leaders)
      without preconditions
      - 2-  sending the military to pakistan (a partner in the war on
      terror) without approval of the govt
      - 3- preventing victory in iraq, even though it's in sight
      - 4- Russia could invade ukraine next (if there's a repeat of  his
      indecision and moral equivalence after georgia invasion)
      - 5- biden's next speaking engagement -- these warnings from joe biden
      are similar to his earlier assessment throughout the primary.
   - Says Obama camp wasnt pleased when his "staged photo-op" was
   interrupted the "real question from a real voter," so now they're attacking
   Joe the Plumber
      - Says problem is Americans are identifying with Joe, Palin cites
      "Tito the builder," a Colombian immigrant who wonders why Obama camp is
      trying to prevent Joe from reaching his dreams
   - Says Obama is "hiding his real agenda" of redistributing your
   hardearned money
      - Calls Obama "the wealth-spreader," keeps up attack that "now is not
      the time to be experimenting with socialism"

Reno, NV: Palin Rally 10/21/08
(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes. If you'd like a
quotable transcript or video of any part below, please email us.)

Background details

   - Piper on stage with Palin
   - Before event, a "God bless the USA" singalong with Lee

Speech Highlights
God bless the USA, beautiful absolutely beautiful. it makes you proud to be
an american.

a couple of ppl id like to intro you to - piper's here. and 1 of my fave 3rd
grade teachers, Mr. Chuck Heath from AK. and todd's on the road, he sends
his very best. so does john mccain

2 wks from today, cast vote for next president. theres no time to domain.com.

a couple of issues in press recently. it is not mean-spirited to talk about
someone's record, someone's plans, or associations.

did you hear that senator biden said at a fund-raiser on sunday that he
guarantees if barack obama is elected we will face an international crisis
within the first six months of their administration? i guess we've got to
say, "thanks for the warning, joe." *he told his dem donors there were at
least 4 -5 scenarios that would threaten Dem administration. he did not
specify what these scenarios would be. you'll just have to go to the obama
foreign-policy agenda for clues. *

*for clues, look to Obama fopo policy. crisis situation #1 meeting with
terrorists without iran without preconditions. #2 sending the military to
pakistan without the approval of the government. invading the sovereign
territory of a partner in the war on terror.  #3 opposed the surge . he's
voted to cut off funding for troops. he wants to pull out, leaving iraqis at
mercy of iranians and shiites. by his own admission, american troops might
want to go back. #4 indecision and moral equivalence after georgia invasion,
russia could invade ukraine next. #5 biden's next speaking engagement*

*the real problem is that these warnings from joe biden are similar to his
earlier assessment throughout the primary.* he said that barack obama was
not up to the job. he is not ready to be president. he said that the
presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training. the
same joe biden who said he would be honored to run on the ticket with john
mccain because he said the country would be better off with john mccain. he
will put the country first, fighting for you.

i want a pres. who's not afirad to say 'victory. a president ready to lead
on day 1, pres w/ judgment truthfulness experience ready to meet-- or better
yet, avoid next internatl crisis. i want mccain as next comm-in-chief

NV, you have great history of understanding of troops. if you would do us
the honor of letting us honor those who have served or are serving. TY. TY
for loving our country

this election going to come down to wire. i know we can count on battle-horn
state. are you ready to make mccain next POTUS? ready to help carry this
state to victory? ready to send us to DC to shake things up?

i know you are here b/c you understand the stakes, for the future. tough
times, more than ever we need tough leader w/ bold and free and fair plan w/
pragmatic solutions. we need mccain.

we'll help families keep homes and retirees keep savings, investments they
worked so hard for and trusted others with. help students. we'll get econ
back on rgith track. first w/ tax relief to all americans and
businesses. small business is backbone. this country is made great by
entreprenerial domain.com. we're going to let you keep more of what you earn and
produce, thats how jobs are created. we'll lower income taxes and double
chidl tax deduction and cut the capital gains tax and cut business taxes -
right now, the business tax in US is 2nd highest in world, we'll cut that to
help keep Am businesses in america.

on taxes, clear choice. our opponent is not being candid about his tax
plans. again, its not neg or meanspirited, we're gonna keep doing this -
calling someone out. its in fairness to you to have everyone understand what
the choice is. *you have to really listen to his words. **he's hiding his
real agenda of redistributing your hardearned money. h**e says hes for a tax
domain.com, which is when govt takes your money and gives it to someone
else.*we're for a tax cut which is when govt just takes less. this
allows you to
invest acc. to your priorities.

we need to hand it to Joe The Plumber. he succeeded in getting our
opponent to do something no one else has: state his agenda in plain
language.  senator obama says that he wants to, quote, spread the wealth. he
wants -- what that means is that government is taking your money and doling
it out however politicians see fit. that's not good for our economy. barack
obama calls it spreading the wealth. joe biden calls higher taxes
patriotic. joe the plumber said it sounded to him like socialism. and now is
not the time to experiment with socialism. so *when he left joe's
neighborhood in toledo, i dont think our opponent was too pleased. their
staged photo-op got ruined w a real person w/ a real question. he asked
question, stood for so many americans. and now theyre investigating and
attacking Joe The Plumber.*

but americans are IDing w/ Joe The Plumber. in NM i saw ed the dairyman, i
saw Tito the builder. here we have dave the cop, ann the engineer, jon the
only GOP in my HS (laughs). tito the builder isnt pleased at how obama camp
and the media have been roughing up Joe The Plumber. Tito wants to know why
the heck are you going after Joe The Plumber? he has an idea, a future, he
has somewhere he wants to go, why are you stopping that? tito is an
immigrant from colombia. he says everyone can do waht they want. i was born
in colombia, but i was made in the usa.

*so tito isnt the only mccain supporter who feel that way.* signs have shown
the same. *if you work hard and want to get ahead and believe america is the
land of possibilites and dont want your hopes dashed by obama tax incr, *and
dont like how he was attacked for asking obama a question, then we're
all Joe The Plumber. do we have some here?  *doesnt sound like we have a lot
of fans of obama the wealth-spreader here today.*

 our opponent's plan discourages productivity and it will stifle the
entrepreneurial domain.com that has made this country unique and it has made it
the greatest country on earth.

our opponent's plan is just more big government, and john and i think that
is the problem, not the solution.  instead of taking your hard-earned money
and spreading your wealth, we want to spread opportunity so people like you
and joe the plumber can create new wealth and create new jobs.

so we're gonna put govt back on side of ppl. we're going to confront the $10
trillion debt that the federal government has run up. thats not right, not
fair, that wont happen on our watch. john and i will impose a spending
freeze in the federal government's budget on but the most vital functions of
government.  we have to do this for the fed gvot to be expected to live w/in
its budget as you are in your homes, in your businesses, as we have to do as
govs and mayors.

you can count on us to follow thru on our promises b/c we're the only ones
w/ track records of reform. we havent just been talking the talk, but walked
the walk.

as a sen, mccain has confronted abuses of pwr and as he'll tell ya, he has
scars to do it. from his own party and from other party also, he's been
known as teh maverick taking on the special interests and insider dealings.
as pres, he'll end them once and for all.

my track record. as mayor, i eliminated personal prop. taxes and sm.
business inventory taxes. we made our town a place where businesses  could
grow and thrive. it was a progrowth, proprivate sector agenda. we were able
to hang that shingle outside our city door that said We're open for
business! and it worked, and we took off a vibrant, booming community b/c we
had a progrwoth, proprivate sector agenda. we got govt out of the way to let
businesses grow and thrive.

as gov, i vetoed nearly $0.5B in wasteful spending. there too, we ruffled
some feathers. we suspended state fuel tax and returned a chunk of surplus
back to ppl b/c they can spend it better than govt can spend it for them.

in AK, we got back to basics and put govt back on side of the ppl, we'll use
that same commonsense approach to reform DC b/c in our admin, i promise
we'll never forget who we're accountable to, we'll be working for you, the
ppl of USA. you the ppl.

are you ready to send us to DC shake things up and clean things up?

john and i will set this country firmly on a path to energy indep. we're
gonna develop new energy sources and tap into what we've already got: oil,
natural gas, coal.  we'll create thousands of new jobs instead of
circulating billions and being beholden to volatile regimes that use energy
as a weapon. we'll develop alternative sources, clean coal technology and
safely drill. we'll drill here and drill now. and that's when you start to
chant. we'll drill baby drill and mine baby mine. for security and for
prosperity and job opportunities, we need american energy by american
ingenuity and american workers. USA!

i appreciate that. you really do get it and i appreciate you guys.

1 of the missions that we'll take on for you, in addition to energy indep
and govt reform, should we be blessed to serve you, esp close to my heart,
that is to help fams w/ kids with special needs. it was mother teresa who
said that god has created everyone of us, every human, for greater things,
to love and be loved. no matter our party or backgrd or affiliations or
gender, there is a voice of humanity there in those words. it speaks to all
of us.  john and i have vision of america where every innocent life counts
and everyone has the chance to contribute. where every child is cherished.
thats the domain.com i want to bring to DC. as gov, i secured more assistance
and funding to students w/ special needs. as VP, we'll do more, ushering
domain.com that says life is sacred, it matters, it should be protected. ill
make sure that children, that all our fams know, yep they'llhave advocate in
WH.

nov 4 coming quickly. itll come down to what we believe in. mccain and i
belivee in what reagan believed in: fwd mvmt of frdm not constant expansion
of govt. best of USA not all gahtered in DC, but in goodness of everyday,
hardworking ppl in ppl in our factories, teaching, fighting our wars,
protecting us and protecting the virtues of frdm. we so believe in the
promise of this country in all of its opportunites. and we believe america
is not the problem, america the solution. USA. we may not be a perf nation
but we learn from our mistakes. collectively we represent some perfect
ideals. we're that beacon of hope for all that seek equality and frdm and
opportunity. we're still that shining city on a hill reagan spoke of.

and i thank god we have a man ready and worthy to lead that nation. he
inspires us w/ heroic and trustworthy deeds and not just words. if you
believe what we believe, you're ready to shake up DC and WS, and you want to
clean up DC, , we're asking for your vote.

you'll hear our opponents go on and on about how they'll "fight for you".
since my running mate usually wont say this for himself, ill tell ya: there
is only 1 candidate in this race who has ever really fought for you. he is
the only man with courage to keep fighting for you. he is john mccain.
