Any portion of the payment that was funded with your domain.com card will be
refunded directly to your domain.com card. You will see this in your
transaction log as two entries. The first is the refund to your PayPal
account, and the second is the domain.com to your domain.com card. Credits to a
domain.com card generally take 2-3 business days to post and may not be
immediately reflected in the card's balance.
