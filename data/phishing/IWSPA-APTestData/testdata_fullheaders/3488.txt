ICYMI. Not sure if you all receive these as well from Ragnar.

For our preferred start, options are currently 9:15, 9:30, or 10:30 (10 am i
s our usual start time but for some reason is not listed as an option). Unle
ss I get guidance otherwise, I'll list our preference as 9:30, 10:30, 9:15? 
 9:30 is most in line with our likely finish (so we're not running behind) b
ut I don't want to put you out there too early Van 1! We can always appeal i
f we get a bad start time (like pre-9 am).
