Also, for this weekend, the Clinton folks are feeding to Sunday Show produc
ers a bunch of background to push back against the notion that Trump is jus
t playing a "part" and that he'll become more professional/presidential in 
the coming weeks and months. They want to remind everyone of all the crazy 
things he's said thus far, that these statements have already caused great 
damage to our country both domestically and internationally, and that Trump
 is who he is and won't change. Bottom line: Trump cannot be trusted and do
es not have the temperament to be President.

That's why I put that messaging near the top of the chair's briefing. I als
o included in the briefing a link to the Washington Post editorial we blast
ed out yesterday that made the aforementioned points quite well; the Clinto
n campaign also blasted.
