   and legal?

   Dear John,

   In just two days, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on whether
   Texas' clinic shutdown law will be allowed to stand, effectively ending
   abortion access for many women by closing 75 percent of the clinics in t
he
   state.^1

   This is the biggest threat to Roe v. Wade in years, and if we lose, the
   state of Texas could be left with just 10 clinics to serve a state with 
27
   million people.

   We're in the midst of an all-out sprint to stop states like Texas from
   gutting abortion access. Will you chip in $15?

   [2]Yes, I'll chip in $15 to defend choice and fight back
   against the Texas clinic shutdowns.

   TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws like the one the
   Supreme Court will consider on Wednesday aim to "trap" abortion providers
   in a web of restrictions that have nothing to do with protecting women's
   health and safety--like strict requirements on the size of janitors'
   closets.^2

   To win, we need five justices to vote to overturn the lower-court decisi
on
   upholding the law. That won't be easy.

   There's too much at stake not to win. In Texas, there were 41 abortion
   providers before this law was put into place. There would be only 10 left
   if the law is upheld, forcing women--especially those in rural areas--to
   travel hundreds of miles to reach a clinic.^3

   We're fighting back by making sure women are heard loud and clear: We wi
ll
   not return to a time of back alley abortion. We demand safe, legal, and
   ACCESSIBLE abortion.

   [3]Will you chip in $15 to help save abortion access?

   Thank you for helping to make reproductive freedom real for all women.

   Ilyse G. Hogue
   President, NARAL Pro-Choice America
