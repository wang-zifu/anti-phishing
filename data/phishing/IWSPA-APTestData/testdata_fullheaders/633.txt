                               time for a snooze

         There comes a time in every August when news services should
         just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too
         underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even
         the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like
         it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can
         barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be
         bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a
         free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or
         getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps
         they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is
         look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the
         window until dawn.

         Yeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster
         server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.

         Or, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for
         the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the "Hyperactive"
         chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as
         you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head
         seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's
         Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn
         about "using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked
         effects", "techniques for making little speakers sound huge"
         and - perhaps most distressingly - "picking the right
         instrument and register for best audibility". The
         cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue
         and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
         yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of
         music lovers worldwide.

                             berating the obvious

         because there are still a few PUERILE GOOGLE MISSPELLINGS

         Boasting technical seminars, interplay of technological ideas
         and, of course, beer, this year's LINUXBIERWANDERUNG (from Sat
         2002-08-24, Doolin, Co. Clare, Ireland, for a "small voluntary
         donation" per hiker) might just be the only walking holiday
         you ever persuade your company to pay for. Continuing the
         outdoor theme, somewhat shorter notice for this Sunday's
         GREATER LONDON LINUX USER GROUP BLETCHLEY PARK PICNIC (around
         12noon, Sun 2002-08-18, Bletchley, near Milton Keynes, UKP6
         admission fee). And for anyone who can't make the whole week
         in Ireland, there's some consolation in the form of LONDON
         PERLMONGERS PRESENT: DAMIEN CONWAY AT THE CONWAY HALL (6pm,
         Tue 2002-08-27 and Thu 2002-08-29, Conway Hall, London WC1R,
         free) - hopefully just the start of a similarly-named speaker/
         venue trend which will also see Larry Wall performing at the
         Great Wall Of China, and Eric Raymond at London's Raymond
         Revue Bar.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Dijkstra finally gone? Great. Now we can hang out with those
         sloppy little unrigorous languages he never let into the
         house. Right on cue: the latest dev version of GNU
         SMALLTALK, that dirty treat-me-like-an-object ducky. Version
         2.0b sprouts HTML-embedding and experimental MySQL support -
         implying you might actually be able to do something useful
         with it. Admittedly, "useful" has not been a word  much used
         in the Smalltalk community recently. Many of the current
         addicts seem to live entirely in the pleasuredomes of that
         Land of Infinite Fun, Alan Kay's Smalltalk sequel SQUEAK,
         the cross-platform UI-kablooie playground which, over time,
         been overloaded with more ill-fitting metaphors than this
         sentence. But even Squeak is showing signs of returning to
         domain.com Earth. Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;
         coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's
         peculiarly homely interface right now). There's even word of
         a SmallTalkish scripting language in the offing. And all
         those new MacOS X Objective C hackers are following the
         trail back to the NeXT's great ancestor, giving a timely
         boost to the tribe. Xerox Parc *will* return!

         our modern-day pop acts... the horror continues in the form of
         CANDYMAN II (1.10am, Fri, C4) and William Peter "The Exorcist"
         Blatty's psycho-nonsense THE NINTH CONFIGURATION (2.45am, Fri,

         simultaneously fruitless THE HUNT FOR THE ANTHRAX KILLER (9pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... Christina Ricci, Lisa Kudrow comedy THE OPPOSITE
         OF SEX (10pm, Sum, C4) has snappy script, no plot... and it's
         the final episode of the seemingly interminable 24 (10pm, Sun,

         rhetorically titled - DID BARRY GEORGE KILL JILL DANDO? (9pm,

         CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> "Are you tracking breakfast cereal?"
         inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into
         the "kiddy end" of the cereal aisle. "They've all gone CD-ROM
         on the front", he observed - causing him, for a moment to
         think he was looking at "some really bloated computer
         magazines". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
         easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
         report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
         domain.com-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
         FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough "frosty"),
         COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
         even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you
         mix them all together, the milk goes so chocolatey it'll turn
         your Pooh brown... elsewhere in dairy, MCDONALD'S continue a
         disappointing run of toppings for the MCFLURRY (99p) -
         Cadbury's Caramel is rubbish, and Jammie Dodgers not a patch
         on our second-favourite McFlurry of all time, the Strawberry
         Crunch: <<link>>#l .
         Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their
         "M&M" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
         "special miniaturised ones", which he describes as "frozen
         solid" and "might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
         chocolate flavour they impart". While, following last week's
         announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
         reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
         of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a "Fear
         Factor" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
         "dirt and spiders": <<link>>
         ... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
         with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, "tasted of plastic...
         [resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
         by now"), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
         CHOC LIMITED EDITION ("Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
         which I never liked because of the thick chocolate"), and the
         whole point of that controversial "It's not for girls"
         campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
         as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other
         treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured
         CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,
         bacon QUAVERS, the (presumably) non-crisp-like GOLDEN WONDER
         FRUIT WONDERS - or, indeed, any of this weird new American
         stuff: <<link>> ,
         ranging from SCORNED WOMAN CHOCOLATE JALAPENO FUDGE to SOFT
         AND CHEWY STINKY FEET ("Mmm, these feet are *so* stinky")...
