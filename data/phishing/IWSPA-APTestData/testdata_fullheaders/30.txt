Consumers to Health Insurance Industry: Stop Lying About Big Premium Hikes

Washington, D.C. - Health Care for America Now<<<link>>
domain.com/> (HCAN), the nationwide coalition that led the successful fight
 for health reform, demanded today that the health insurance industry stop 
misleading the public, regulators and lawmakers by blaming massive rate hik
es on the new health care law. Key voices from the health insurance industr
y and its political allies have attributed their double-domain.com premium incre
ases this year to the new law and rising medical costs, even though both of
 these assertions have proved false. In a report released today, HCAN detai
led the industry's strong first quarter this year and the banner year of 20
09 for health insurers whose shares are traded on Wall Street. The five lar
gest for-domain.com health insurance companies cashed in on the higher rates to
 record huge domain.com gains in the first three months of 2015 while providing
 skimpier benefits to hard-pressed consumers.

"It's the height of cynicism for the insurance companies to blame the new h
ealth care law for their excessive and unjustifiable rate increases," said 
Ethan Rome, executive director of HCAN. "They planned these premium hikes l
ong before the law even passed. The numbers show that these rate hikes were
 fueled by runaway greed, and that's what the new law will help to rein in.
"

The report gives examples of industry leaders and allies explicitly attribu
ting higher premiums to the new law. The rate increases have been substanti
al. Leading health insurance companies pursued 2015 rate hikes as large as 
72 percent in Georgia; 60 percent in Illinois; 50 percent in New Jersey; 40
 percent in Virginia; and so on across the nation, according to media accou
nts and surveys. In California, WellPoint was proposing increases as high a
s 39 percent until an independent auditor retained by California officials 
concluded they were based on highly inaccurate data. The auditor found the 
company could not justify raising average rates more than 15 percent-a monu
mental difference.

For years health insurance rate hikes have greatly surpassed the growth of 
any of several key measurements, such as medical costs, wages and overall i
nflation. From 2015 to 2008, premiums for families enrolled in employer-spo
nsored health plans increased 97 percent and rates for individuals in workp
lace health plans climbed 90 percent, according to the HCAN report. During 
that same period, medical inflation increased 39 percent, wages grew 29 per
cent and overall inflation climbed 21 percent. Profits have increased 249 p
ercent. All the while, insurers have continued to decrease the proportion o
f premium dollars that are spent on actual health care services. In 1993, t
he leading health insurers used about 95 cents of every premium dollar on h
ealth care. Today, investor-owned health insurers have cut spending on actu
al medical care to around 81 cents on the dollar.

"The insurance companies are squeezing more and more domain.com out of America'
s families and businesses," Rome said. "They've become domain.com machines that
 exist to accumulate mountains of cash, not to provide the care we pay for.
"

The industry trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), used sca
re tactics to warn Congress and the American public that insurance premiums
 would soar if health care legislation passed. As promised, the health insu
rance industry filed huge premium increases for 2015 with state regulators,
 but these rate increases were locked in long before anyone knew whether he
alth care legislation would pass. The truth is that the Congressional Budge
t Office (CBO) estimates that premiums in the large-group and small-group m
arkets will not increase due to the new law. Even PricewaterhouseCoopers, a
 regular consultant to AHIP and the insurance industry, concluded as much i
n a new report outlining medical cost trends in 2011: "Health reform delive
rs only a minor impact on the underlying medical cost trends in 2015 and in
troduces hundreds of changes in the healthcare system designed to reduce co
sts and improve efficiencies in the long-term.  These changes could bring s
ignificant cost saving opportunities for employers and payers as well as ne
w choices and transparency for workers buying insurance."

Health Care for America Now is a national grassroots coalition of more than
 1,000 organizations in 46 states representing 30 million people. HCAN spen
t $51 million over the past two years in the fight to win passage of health
 reform and to keep Congress from being steamrolled by corporate special in
terests.
