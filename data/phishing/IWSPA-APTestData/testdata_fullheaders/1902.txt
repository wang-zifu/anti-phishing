John--
Confidentially, I wanted to reach out to let you know that while I'm honore
d to be part of Priorities, I would be happy to flip to the campaign if nee
ded. 
Here's where I think my skills could be helpful:  on the surrogate side, wh
ere I know she will have an enormous demand, I could be a surrogate to stat
es, state dem parties (particularly if you need people in states or at time
s where she will not be able to campaign), make appearances on local or nat
ional media, meet with local electeds, listening to local dems, etc.  While
 Priorities' role is obviously key, I'd be happy to serve in any other role
 as well.  I'm pretty good at connecting with dems anywhere, getting them m
otivated, and message delivery. 
Just wanted to let you know, as you plug people into roles on the campaign 
side. 
Obviously I'm happy to be involved either way.
Best --
