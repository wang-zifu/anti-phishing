Roll Call: Senate GOP Staff Meet With Lobbyists on Jobs Bill
<<link>>
Senate Republican leadership staff are huddling with K Streeters this after
noon over Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) decision to forgo a 
bipartisan jobs package in favor of a smaller, targeted plan.

The meeting is expected to draw staff from the offices of Senate Minority L
eader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Orrin Hatch
 (Utah), according to a lobbyist planning to attend the meeting.

"People are curious and want to know what's happening," the lobbyist said.

The business community has been up in arms since Reid decided to ditch a bi
partisan job-creation bill last week. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D
-Mont.) and the ranking member Grassley had crafted a package that would ha
ve including extensions for tax credits favored by the business community. 
Reid is now pushing a more targeted package.

Senate Republicans have voiced concern about Reid's handling of the jobs bi
ll. The meeting comes as Reid has begun reaching out to Republicans to try 
to ensure bipartisan support.
