Meet with Fleetmatics at NAFA, enter to win a driver!

Hi Amy,

Fleetmatics has some exciting news to share, and we’d like you to be the first to hear! Stop by Fleetmatics Booth #920 at the NAFA Institute & Expo, April 9-10, and you can enter to win a TaylorMade RocketBallz Stage 2 driver. 



Even better, take this brief survey in advance and we’ll bring you a Columbia fleece jacket as our thanks*.  You can still sign up to win a driver, too!



See you there,

Craig Paulette

* Promotion limited to fleet management employees of organizations with a business fleet of 25 or more vehicles.  Offer valid April 9-10 at NAFA Institute & Expo in Minneapolis, MN only.  Offer good while supplies last, and only one winner per person or organization.  This offer is not transferable and is made without warranty of any kind, express or implied.  No purchase necessary.  Offer void where prohibited, taxed, or restricted by law. In the event a Taylormade Rocketballz Stage 2 Driver or Columbia fleece jacket is not available, a replacement of equal value will be provided at Fleetmatics’ sole discretion.  TaylorMade and Columbia are not participating partners or sponsors in this offer.
