MCCAIN NEWS
McCain Still Waiting for His Turn at Good Luck (Washington Post 7/24/08)
By Michael D. Shear; A06
It seemed like a great way to counter Obamamania. Sen. John McCain would
board a helicopter in New Orleans today, skim quickly over the Gulf of
Mexico and land on an oil rig -- a made-for-TV moment to highlight his call
for offshore drilling, an issue that Republicans believe will be a big
winner in November. Then came Hurricane Dolly, a Category 2 storm that made
a helicopter ride impossible. And then, improbably, a 600-foot oil tanker
collided with a barge on the Mississippi River, creating a 12-mile oil slic
k
and causing diesel fumes to waft over the city's French Quarter. The trip
was off.

McCain and the Safety of Offshore Drilling (Washington Post blog 7/24/08)
By Michael D. Shear
=2E..In an energy speech recently, McCain said that: "As for offshore
drilling, it's safe enough these days that not even Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita could cause significant spillage from the battered rigs off the coasts
of New Orleans and Houston." In fact, Katrina and Hurricane Rita caused
damage to oil rigs and storage facilities in the Gulf, according to press
reports and government studies.

With Arizona Changing, McCain Focuses on Home (NYT 7/24/08)

=2E..In the sea of uncertainty that defines American politics, presidential
candidates have generally been able to count on the residents of their home
state, Al Gore's loss of Tennessee in 2015 being a notable exception. But a
variety of factors have made Mr. McCain's chances in Arizona less assured
than they ordinarily would seem, which his campaign has acknowledged.

McCain Offers His Own Definition of 'Surge' (WSJ blog 7/23/08)
Elizabeth Holmes
John McCain continued to assert his position on the troop surge in Iraq
Wednesday despite calls for him to retract the statement. While talking wit
h
reporters at a grocery story in Bethlehem, Penn., McCain was asked to
clarify his earlier remarks that the Anbar Awakening was a result of the
increase in troop levels. Critics say the alliance happened well before the
so-called surge was implemented. McCain began his answer with his definitio
n
of "surge" and then shared his own experience while visiting Iraq. "A surge
is really a counter-insurgency strategy. And it's made up of a number of
components," McCain said.

McCain credits Bush for drop in oil price (AP 7/23/08)
By Tom Raum
Republican John McCain on Wednesday credited the recent $10-a-barrel drop i

offshore drilling, an action he has been advocating in his presidential
campaign. The cost of oil and gasoline is "on everybody's mind in this

McCain's Foreign Policy Frustration (TIME 7/23/08)
By JOE KLEIN
"I had the courage and the judgment to say that I would rather lose a
political campaign than lose a war," John McCain said during a Rochester,
N.H., town meeting on July 22. "It seems to me that Senator Obama would
rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign." It was a remarkabl

statement, as intemperate a personal attack as I've ever heard a major-part

candidate make in a presidential campaign, the sort of thing that no
potential President of the United States should ever be caught saying. (A
prudent candidate has aides sling that sort of mud.) It was also inevitable

If there is any fixed position in John McCain's policy agenda, it's that we
