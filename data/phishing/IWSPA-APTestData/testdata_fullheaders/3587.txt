*Weekly IE Watch*

6/28 =96 7/ 11

*                 Over the course of several years, conservatives have
invested in building a network of 527s and third-party organizations that
operate beyond the limits of partisan campaigns. A group of very wealthy,
extremely committed individuals has already contributed millions of dollars
and will continue to pour money into these organizations over the course of
the election. These organizations are led by the same strategists and
consultants responsible for the conservative media campaign against Kerry in
2004. They stand poised and ready to attack the Democratic nominee.*

* *

*In early spring 2004, all signs indicated a Democratic victory. Voters
liked, respected, and supported John Kerry. Then on March 2, the day after
Kerry secured the Democratic nomination, Republicans began an
85-million-dollar media campaign across 18 battleground states that ran for
90 days =96 and likely cost Kerry the presidency. The Republican media
strategy used independent organizations to pick up where Bush and the RNC
left off. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and the Progress for America
Voter Fund alone spent $58 million.  All indications are that the right wing
will engage in a similar campaign this year.  *

 Right Wing Groups In The News This Week

*RNC Launched 10-Day, $3 Million Ad Campaign Against Obama.
**Politico*reported, "An independent expenditure arm of the Republican
National
Committee has begun a 10-day, $3 million ad campaign in swing states
attacking Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as 'just the party line.'  The
30-second ad, called 'Balance,' is read by a narrator and focuses on energy
at a time when gas prices are the top issue on voters' minds."

=B7         *NPR Analysis: RNC Has Over 12:1 Financial Advantage Over DNC. *
*
NPR* reported, "The Republicans, the RNC, has a lot more money to spend on
ads.  They have about over $50 million in the bank.  The Organizationhas, ya know,
$4 million in the bank, and I hear they're not even paying for their
convention."  Appearing as a guest on NPR, John Harris, editor-in-chief of
Politico, highlighted the significant advantage the RNC has over the DNC:
"The Republican National Committee is pretty well funded.  The DNC, which a
lot of Democratic activists like, they like Howard Dean, they like the fact
that he is an organizer and has promised to campaign in all 50 states, isn't
a great fundraising machine under Dean's leadership, so the historic
advantage that Republicans have over Democrats in that one area still
prevails." [NPR<<<link>>

about 15 battleground states in the Midwest and Mountain West*."
