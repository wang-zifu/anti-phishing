Sometime soon I am going to suggest that Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and Bill 
de Blasio create the equivalent of a People's PAC to raise huge amounts of 
money from small donors---after the convention---to support electing libera
ls at all levels....including but far beyond Hillary assuming she is nomina
ted.....

Beyond this Hillary should stop attacking Bernie, especially when she says 
things that are untrue, which candidly she often does. I am one of the peop
le with credibility to suggest Bernie people support her in November, and s
he and Benenson and others have no idea of the damage she does to herself w
ith these attacks, which she does not gain by making.

Instead the smart move would be to look for issues where she can dovetail w
ith Bernie.  One I am definitely going to suggest would be to take his prop
osal for a free public college education paid for by a transaction tax on W
all Street speculation and add one new dimension....that to receive this be
domain.com young people should devote one year to some form of community or publ
ic service....
There is no reason Hillary cannot not support this....

Right now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republ
icans nominating Trump....she has huge endemic political weaknesses that sh
e would be wise to rectify.....even a clown like Ted Cruz would be an even 
money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me.....
