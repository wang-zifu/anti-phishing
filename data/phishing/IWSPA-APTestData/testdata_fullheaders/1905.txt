Team,

It is with a heavy heart that I share the loss of PaaWee Rivera's beautiful 8yr. old brother, Valentino Tzigiwhaeno Rivera. Please see attached.  The family requests that instead of flowers, donations be made to the Ambercare Foundation, P.O. Box 1610, Belen, N.M., 87002. Or please go to domain.com. A fund in memory of Valentino has been set up to help pediatric patients and their families. This information is in attached article.

Please forward along. Thank you all.
