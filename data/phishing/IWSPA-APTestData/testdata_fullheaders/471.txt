Things don't really work that way, but we can work on a letter to be read.

 right person!

e agency in Worcester, MA.  Gordon Hargrove, their Executive Director, is ce
lebrating 50 years at Friendly House and 47 as CEO, at a large community din
ner in late June. I am on the committee working on the celebration and plan t
o travel up to attend the dinner.

he President with a very specific request.  Because the President will be in
 Worcester the week before the dinner to deliver the commencement speech at W
orcester Tech, they are asking if there is a possibility to record a brief v
ideo with him while there that could be used as part of the tribute at the d
inner.

s in asking my friends like you and Jeanne for favors and connections.  I am
 pushing this boundary because my client and friend Gordon is a very special
 human being who does God=E2=80=99s work in ways that are humbling and power
ful.  What I hope you can give me is the connection I need so that the Commi
ttee can get the letter to the best person in the system who will try and ma
ke turning the video request into a reality.  Jim McGovern is our usual loca
l resource and go-to-guy, but I am thinking that you may have a more direct c
onnection.
