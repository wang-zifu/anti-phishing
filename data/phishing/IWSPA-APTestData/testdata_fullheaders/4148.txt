Dear LaSalle Bank customer,

We 
recently noticed one or more attempts to login intro your LaSalle Bank online 
banking account for a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that 
your account was hijacked by a third party without your notification.

            If you recently 
logged intro your account while traveling to a foreign country, the unusual 
login attempts may have been made by you.

            However if you 
are the rightful owner of the account, click on the link below and domain.com as we 
are truing to verify your account information. (In case you are not enrolled use 
your Social Security number as you User ID and the first six digits of your 
Social Security number as a password).

<>

            The login attempt 
was made from :

IP: 82.89.87.55
ISP Host: 
host55-87.domain.com

            IF YOU CHOSE TO 
IGNORE OUR REQUEST, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND YOUR ONLINE 
BANKING ACCOUNT.
