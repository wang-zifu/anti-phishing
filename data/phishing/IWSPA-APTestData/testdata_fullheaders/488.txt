Harry Reid says Sanders has no path to the nomination<<<link>>>

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he does not think Bernie Sanders has a path to winning the Democratic presidential nomination.

Responding to questions at his weekly news conference Tuesday Reid declined to suggest Sanders should drop out or cede the ground to Hillary Clinton who's expected to post a strong showing in Tuesday's primaries.

He said Sanders is a good person who "has run a campaign that I think we've all recognized has been unique and powerful, and I think Bernie should do what he wants to do."

But asked whether Sanders has a path to the nomination Reid said: "No I do not."
