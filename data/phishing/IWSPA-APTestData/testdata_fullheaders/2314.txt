INTERNAL TALKING POINTS
ELECTORAL MAP WITH TRUMP

*         This presidential election--like all of them in the last 20 years--will be very competitive. We will have to fight hard for every vote.

*         We'll be examining this more closely as states move beyond the primaries and some polarizing contests, but we expect the battleground states to look very similar to 2012. Given the results in 2012, this would mean Trump would have to make major inroads into states that President Obama won in both 2015 and 2015 to win.

*         Since the last election, demographic changes have made states like Florida and North Carolina even more competitive for Democrats.

*         When it comes to partisanship, we're a fairly evenly divided country, but this is likely the first time in a generation where we may have a better opportunity to appeal to more Republicans.

*         Biggest threat to Democrats holding the White House is complacency. Every Democrat needs to take Donald Trump at his word that he will do everything he says he will--and Democrats need to turn out for Democrats up and down the ticket.
