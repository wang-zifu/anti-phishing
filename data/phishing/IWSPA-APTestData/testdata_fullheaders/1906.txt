According to Gallup, US businesses lost between $250-300 billion in lost productivity last year due to negativity. Whether it's negativity, incivility, bullying, harassment, insubordination or disruptive behavior, it's all drama says Marlene Chism, author of Stop Workplace Drama (Wiley 2011).

Could it be that we are all using different language for the same issue?

In this teleseminar Marlene introduces a new language and fascinating imagery to illustrate the intimate connection between personal drama and workplace drama, and the practical tools to identify and eliminate drama at the core.

This program is designed to help managers understand why drama hampers productivity and stands in the way of achieving the corporate mission and departmental goals.

Come to this session to find out why nipping drama in the bud is dangerous, how to identify the three core components present in every type of drama as well as practical tools for transforming drama into clarity.

No matter how workplace drama shows up in our organization, the tools and methods presented in this webinar translates from business to personal, with the power and potential to improve all areas of life.

Marlene has a Communications degree from Drury University and a Master's degree from Webster University in Human Resources Development.

Key learning points include:

A new language to use to motivate employees 

How to identify the three common components always present in workplace drama 

How clarity can change any situation 

A method for eliminating time-wasters and eliminating drama at the core 

Practical communication skills and mindset tools to promote teamwork and collaboration
