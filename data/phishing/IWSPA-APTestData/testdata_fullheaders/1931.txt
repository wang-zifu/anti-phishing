John --

I wanted to say thank you before the midnight deadline passes.
And I'm looking forward to thanking four of you in person over
dinner sometime soon.

If you haven't thrown your name in the hat yet, make a donation
of $5 or more before midnight tonight -- you'll
be automatically entered for a chance to be one of our guests.

More soon,

Barack
