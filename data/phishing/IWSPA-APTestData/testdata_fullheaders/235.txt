Subject: Throw Big Oil off the fiscal cliff

<<link>>

Tell your members of Congress to end Big Oil handouts, not
environmental protections!

John,

We've got an idea for Congress: How about instead of cutting
investments that  support our families, protect our health, and
preserve our environment, we  finally get rid of those handouts that give o
il
companies billions of our taxpayer  dollars every year to keep
polluting our air and waterways?

It seems like the most obvious plan, but right now Big Oil's
congressional allies are pushing hard to do just the opposite as
Congress looks  for a way to deal with the so-called "fiscal cliff."
Big Oil's allies in  Congress want to protect special tax breaks for
dirty energy companies while cutting  investments in conservation,
clean energy, and public health. =A0That makes no sense. But unless
Congress hears  from us now, they might just have their way.

Email your members of Congress today:  Tell them to throw Big Oil
off the fiscal cliff, not the environmental programs  that we all
depend on! <<link>>

Big Oil has already recorded over $90 billion in profits so far in
2012. Yet  the oil industry continues to receive $4 billion in
taxpayer subsidies every  year.=A0 It is unacceptable that Big
Oil's  congressional cronies would have us fork over our tax dollars
to these  corporate polluters, while being forced to cut programs that
protect our health  and our environment. But even though environmental
programs only make up 1.25%  of the national budget, some members of
Congress think we can somehow balance  the budget by further
decimating these critical programs. They would:

=A0=A0=A0=A0- Eliminate tax credits that have helped the wind industry grow
,

=A0=A0=A0=A0- Starve our National Parks of funding,

=A0=A0=A0=A0- Cut programs for clean energy research and innovation,

=A0=A0=A0=A0- Undermine efforts to clean up contaminated waterways, and

=A0=A0=A0=A0- End programs that support more than 130 National Wildlife Ref
uges.

We can't afford to lose these programs that keep our water  clean,
protect the places and wildlife we love, and build the infrastructure
we  need to curb global warming. So we need to make sure that Congress
hears loud  and clear that their constituents will not allow our
health and our future to  be traded away -- especially not while they
keep doling out billions to dirty  energy companies.

Send a message to  your members of Congress right now urging them to
put an end to Big Oil  handouts, not our environmental protection
programs. <<link>>

If we ended the handouts that we currently give to oil and  gas
companies, it would save more than $40 billion over the next 10 years.
Given the furor over cutting wasteful spending, this should be a
no-brainer. But Congress won't do it without hearing from you today.

So we hope you'll join us in asking your member of  Congress to stop
subsidizing an industry that harms our health, and invest  instead in clean
 energy jobs that  will that strengthen our environment, our economy, and o
ur energy independence. <<link>>
