a couple of things

All set with eloise, many thanks, she and jamie are on their way to cambridge on wednesday.  Jack called me this morning asking me to reach out to Natalie Portman to be the class day speaker.  I will do so this week and get a quick response.  Last question, and maybe we can talk on the phone to this point.  A very close and old friend of mine, Stephen Warnke, he was a year above me at Harvard, but I know him since I was 13 rang me about his daughter.  Perhaps you and I could chat when you have a moment.  best, M
