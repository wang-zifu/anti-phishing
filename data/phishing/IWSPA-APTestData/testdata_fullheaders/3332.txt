Hi all,
I hope all is well with everyone.
I was just wondering if this was in the works again.  We vote for Truckee.=20

Just saw John's face on Fox Business.  Scary liberal guy trying to implement
 Obama's third term, or so they say.  Watch out!

ote:

our interests and availability.

ckee where they have a condo.   This would certainly offer different opportu
nities for activities.  The suggestion is for July.

emorial Day weekend. 

riced hotel near by and would gladly offer our house as a place to hang out.
  No suggestion for timing.

t is interesting and doable for you.  We're open to multiple gatherings, eve
n if not everyone can participate in each one.  Patti, Mary & I are talking a
bout driving from Chicago to Truckee in July so I expect that Glenn, John & H
arry will be joining us.  However if that doesn't work for you, we can also h
ave a Memorial Day gathering in Winchester and/or a Chicago-based gathering a
t some other time.

elihood of your being able to join us.
