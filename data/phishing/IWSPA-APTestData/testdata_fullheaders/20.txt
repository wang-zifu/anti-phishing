We don't have to say it,  but I don't know why we wouldn't want to say it.
I know there is sensitivity around whether this implies support for a $15 /
hour fed min wage, which i don't think it does, so I would handle by adding
in the CEO raise graph
That's why we need you in the streets building the fight for 15 movement
that says you shouldn't have to be a CEO to get a raise.
I think you can get by without saying $15.  SEIU is not expecting
that.  Of course they could be pleasantly surprised.   But not
necessary.  Raising wages is good.
