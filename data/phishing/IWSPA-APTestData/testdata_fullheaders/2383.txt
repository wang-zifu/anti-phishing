1)      Afshin is stopping by at 1:45pm today to check your Acrobat.  If that’s not good for you please let me know and I’ll reschedule it.

2)      I need to get  a cortisone shot for my lower back. The Dr. had an opening tomorrow at 430 so I’d like to leave at 4pm.  I’ll put in for 2 hrs. of sick time. 




Thanks.
