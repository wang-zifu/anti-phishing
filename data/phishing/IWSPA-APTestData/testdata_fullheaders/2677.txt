 MCCAIN POOL REPORT #3 8/7/08

MCCAIN STATEMENT
Wilmington, Ohio
August 7, 2015 

Note: more coming on the meeting. This is the full verbate of the statement
he gave to the press.

Congressman Mike Turner

"I want to thank Sen. McCain for being here today. This is an incredibly
important issue for all of Ohio but specifically for Wilmington, Ohio. This
is a town that's very troubled by the prospect of losing 8,000 jobs in an
area that would impact a nine-county area.
The senator very thoughtfully listened to the stories of those who have
families and those that would be impacted, those who have jobs. We
appreciate the senator coming here to highlight the struggles that is (sic)
occurring here and really to take a greater look at what the implications
are if this transaction goes forward for this town. We appreciate him being
here and Senator, thank you for listening."

Senator McCain

"Well thank you congressman Turner and thank you for your chairmanship or
co-chairmanship of a bipartisan task force of citizens and involved
officials including the great mayor of Wilmington and others and assembling
a task force to try to address the issue in a comprehensive fashion both in
attempting to highlight the anti-competitive aspects of this issue but also
to be prepared in case these 8 to 10,000 great individuals who may face
unemployment are cared for are given the benefits and assistance that the
need in this already troubled area of our economy.
So I thank you Congressman Turner and I thank Mary Houghtaling who brought
this attention to my issue to my attention graphically even though I had
known about it in the past, in most graphic fashion at town hall meeting on
July the ninth. So I'm very impressed the way that the community has come
together and I'm deeply troubled by the specter of job loss confronting the
town of Wilmington and this entire area, nine counties.
My concerns are being reinforced in my meeting today with those facing the
most personal consequences of what may happen here if the agreement pending
between DHL and UPS is finalized. Should this happen DHL will cede
significant elements of control over cost and service quality to one of its
chief competitors.  This raises serious concerns that consumers all over
America would suffer in terms of cost and quality in the services provided.
And I'm a strong supporter of our anti-trust laws and I believe they should
be vigorously enforced.  I fully support a federal anti-trust review of the
case but I do not prejudge its disposition. In the meantime, planning must
proceed to ensure that in the even the transaction does go through the rapi
d
response assistance mechanism=97local state and federal=97are in place. Job
retention must remain our overriding concern and wee should explore all
options for proceeding with a viable commercial development plan if DHL
ceases operations in Wilmington.
National emergency grant funding should be released to assure any potential
response efforts have the resources necessary to meet the challenges ahead
and we must have an effective displaced worker assistance and training
program in place.
Now I believe that congressional oversight is necessary. I believe that the
justice department should conduct a thorough and complete investigation as
rapidly as possible. I believe it would be important for the chief decision
makers at Deutsche Post would come here, come here to Wilmington and come
here to Ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision and
meet with the people and their representatives because of the impact this
decision made a long ways away from the state of Ohio.
So I'm very pleased to be here today, I appreciate the opportunity. I see
the way that this community and area has come together. I congratulate the
governor and the senators and our congressional delegation and all involved
and I will do everything I can to be of assistance. Thank you very much."
