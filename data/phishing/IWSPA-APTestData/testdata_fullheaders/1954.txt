All,




With the change to the dates for the Global Compliance Conference, we will also be changing the date of the Global Legal Meeting.  




Please change your calendars to save Tuesday, May 20, 2015 for the Global Legal Meeting.  We will still plan on having both morning and afternoon sessions that day and will plan an enjoyable dinner that evening.




If you forget to change your calendar and show up on Monday, we’ll try to find you some office space and get you a sandwich from the cafeteria to hold you over until the scheduled activities commence Tuesday morning!




Best regards, 




Natsuko, Masa and Mark

Subject: REVISED DATES 2015 Global Compliance Conference




To All:




     Please be advised that the 2015 Global Compliance Conference is scheduled for Wednesday, May 21- Thursday, May 22, 2015 at our offices in NYC.    I apologize for any inconvenience and unnecessary confusion but the original “Save the Date” notice incorrectly specified Tuesday, May 20 and Wednesday, May 21 as the tentative dates.   




     Please let me know if you would like to present at the conference and/or have any suggestions for conference topics.  I will be distributing a tentative agenda by early next month.      




I look forward to seeing you there!




Best regards, Kathleen
