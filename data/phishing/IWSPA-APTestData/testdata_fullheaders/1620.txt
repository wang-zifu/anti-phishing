Well, that doesn't sound annual, then.

I am afraid my parents are visiting that weekend and we are going to the eas
tern shore.

I hadn't thought you had fallen off disclosure train.  Think only thing you m
issed was call Cheryl set up yesterday with extended Clinton world so all we
re mirandized on what was in PFD and timing of release.  At any rate i tried
 to get you on a number of calls on a few different issues yesterday and ear
lier in the week but you were raising money, traveling or grading.  I hear y
ou are in NYC for three days next week?   That's exciting.

Btw - I am in Idaho this weekend with super spotty service, so kind of hard t
o reach.  Hope you guys have a good weekend.  Cold here but beautiful.
