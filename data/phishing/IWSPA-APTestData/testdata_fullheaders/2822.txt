February 26, 2015 

We are excited to announce that* Media Matters for America* has scheduled
its next Progressive Talent Initiative (PTI) media training. PTI is an
intensive, four day media training program beyond the scope of anything in
the progressive movement to date.

PTI will train participants on a wide variety of topics including technique
,
messaging, tactics, style and hot button issues such as national security,
immigration, health care, etc. The next training will occur in April 2015 i
n
Washington, D.C. Applicants selected will have all travel, training, and
accommodations paid for and arranged by PTI.

The relationship between PTI and graduates of the program will not end in
April. PTI will aggressively book graduates and provide graduates with
access to preparatory resources. In order to ensure that the lessons learne
d
at the training are not lost over time, continued feedback, training, and
post performance critique will be a core component of the program.

In order to provide the most hands-on experience, PTI is only selecting
twelve participants for this training.  Applicants should be able to speak
intelligently on current issues and have a strong on-camera presence.

Participants are expected to fully engage in the training from the morning
of Wednesday, April 14th through the early afternoon of Saturday, April
17th. While breaks will be provided throughout the training, participants
should not plan on being available for work or other personal commitments
for the duration of the program. Participants are also expected to be
available for media appearances after the training as part of the ongoing
relationship with PTI.

The application for the April 2015 training can be found here:
<<link>>

The application provides a space to include at least one but no more than
three URLs to provide a video clip of you on TV. Please use the application
as an avenue to showcase your talents and why you feel you should be
selected to participate in the program. Please note in the application if
you were referred by a specific organization or individual.

Applications will be reviewed by a committee comprised of experts in the
field and PTI team members. All decisions are at the discretion of the
review committee and details regarding why an applicant was or was not
chosen will not be disclosed. Please be advised that during the review
process the PTI team may contact you for additional information.

The early application deadline is Friday March 12, 2015 at 5:00pm EST.

We thank you in advance for your interest in the Progressive Talent
Initiative media training and look forward to receiving your application.
Additional questions can be directed to Kelly Ronan at user@domain.com
.
Again, the first application deadline is 5:00pm EST on Friday March 12,
2010.

Regards,

The PTI Team
