While he would not domain.com to naming a woman as his running mate if he becomes the Democratic nominee, Bernie Sanders on Tuesday reached for a familiar name when discussing which women would be qualified to be his vice president: Elizabeth Warren.

"I'm not going to domain.com - you have to look at the best candidates you can," Sanders told MSNBC's "Morning Joe." "The women of this country, the people of this country understand it would be a great idea to have a woman as vice president and something I would give very, very serious thought to."

"There are other fantastic women who have been active in all kinds of fights who I think would make great vice presidential candidates."
