Hi John!

Claudia is a very good friend who just retired from running the NY
lobbying practice at a big law firm. She is very saavy and experienced.
She and her husband are now spending about half their time in Jackson
Hole. She read that the campaign is going to have an operation there and
she would like to volunteer. Can you tell me who she should contact?

I know you are more than fully engaged when you are in town but if you
ever have time for a quick meal of drink I would love to see you. Happy
to come out to Brooklyn Heights.

Best,

Carol
