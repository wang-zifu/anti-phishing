Only 2 Weeks Left to Make a Difference

The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles    




         Dear Amy,

You have the power to make a big difference in the lives of members of our local Jewish community who are counting on our support. But with only two weeks left in the year, time is running out to put your Jewish values into action in 2013.

Make your gift to The Jewish Federation’s 2015 Annual Campaign right now. 

Your gift could be the one that makes sure:

A child without regular access to food has a nutritious meal.

A father out of work receives critical job counseling after an unexpected layoff.

A frail Holocaust survivor is given basic medications and homecare to live with dignity.

We do all of this and much more, but we can only reach so many people without your generosity. The more funds we raise by the end of the year, the more lives we will be able to impact.

In addition to helping Jews in need, your gift will support our critical work engaging with the community and ensuring the Jewish future we all share. Together, we truly can accomplish the extraordinary.
