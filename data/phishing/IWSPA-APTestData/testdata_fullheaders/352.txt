Want me to reach out to Schultz and see what they have planned? Would be good to amplify.

We also had the idea to do a release w these three points:

*         Biden vine - OBL dead / general motors still alive

*         Clip showing that GM had best year ever

*         Clip showing that POTUS has taken out 30k terrorists

Let me know how to proceed.
