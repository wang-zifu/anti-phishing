Why Loyalty Programs Are Critical in 2015 

Existing customers are your most valuable. According to data from both Forrester and Adobe:

Existing customers account for approximately 50% of a companies total annual revenues

Repeat customers spend up to 8x more per transaction

To make up for the revenue impact of losing a 1 loyal customer, a company would need to acquire approximately 5 new customers

A multi-channel loyalty program not only helps you acquire customers, it gives you a way of better retaining the ones you've already spent time and money getting. What's the ROI of loyalty?
