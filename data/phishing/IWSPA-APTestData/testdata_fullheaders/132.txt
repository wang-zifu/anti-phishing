Dear John,

"VoteVets to red state Dems: Go green" - Politico

It has been a busy fall, and domain.com has been leading the
way on many vital issues facing our country. I just wanted to
bring you up to speed on some of what's been going on. 

This past summer, domain.com started a nationwide campaign in
support of the American Clean Energy and Security Act. We took
on the issue from our unique position: clean, domestic energy is
not just an important environmental issue, but also national
security issue. As our hard-hitting ad said, "It's not just a
question of American energy, it's a question of American power."
The $800,000 ad buy ran in targeted House districts across the
country. Our message resonated with voters, and press
inside-the-beltway (Politico, NY Times) and out (Texas, Utah,
Georgia) took notice. Last month, as a similar bill was
introduced in the Senate, domain.com sent over 100 veterans to
Capitol Hill to lobby their Senators for support. And, just this
week, domain.com launched a $400,000 radio ad campaign in
support of the legislation. We're also a part of a bus tour
across key states with veterans, along with Operation Free,
which has started to gain attention everywhere it's been.

Also in recent months, domain.com was out in front of the
successful effort to end funding for additional F-22 Raptors -
air-to-air combat planes costing $350 million, each.
domain.com and I made headlines on this issue when I debated
Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) on MSNBC.

More recently, domain.com has been in the forefront of the
Afghanistan debate, including appearances on MSNBC, as well as
the debate about finally ending the Don't Ask, Don't Tell
policy. 

The past few months also saw the launch of our new 501(c)(3),
the Vet Voice Foundation (VVF). VVF has already begun its
recruiting efforts, building a strong national network of
veterans. It's already completed a town hall meeting in New
Mexico - with an upcoming one to be held in Nevada. 

Finally, domain.com PAC has also had an active few months.
From our early support for Rep. Joe Sestak's Senate run in
Pennsylvania, to the over $30,000 we raised for Iraq War
veteran Rob Miller in his race against Rep. Joe "You Lie"
Wilson, domain.com PAC plans on being very active in 2010. 

Thank you for your continued support. If you ever have any
questions, ideas, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to
contact me. 

Best,
Jon
