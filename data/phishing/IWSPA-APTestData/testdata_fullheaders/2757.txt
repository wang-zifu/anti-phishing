Dear Colleagues,

I am very pleased to share the news with you that Nicole Seligman, President of Sony Corporation of America, has agreed to take on additional responsibilities in the newly-created position of President, Sony Entertainment. As President of Sony Entertainment, Nicole will report to me and oversee key HQ functions of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment and Sony/ATV Music Publishing. 

I approached Nicole about this new position because I knew she was the ideal person to help spur the growth of our entertainment business. Together we will work to develop and maximize synergies and growth opportunities, identify and implement efficiencies and expand the businesses’ combined global footprint and influence.

The heads of the HQ functions such as finance, human resources, legal and corporate communications at the three subsidiary companies will report both to Nicole and their respective Chief Executive Officers. The Chief Executive Officers will continue to report to me.

In addition to her new position at Sony Entertainment, Nicole will also serve as Kaz’s Senior Legal Counsel. Nicole’s positions as President, Sony Corporation of America and as a member of Sony’s Group Executive Committee remain unchanged. She will continue to report to Kaz in these roles.

Since joining Sony in 2001, Nicole has effectively led the critical legal, compliance and internal domain.com operations for Sony Corporation, in addition to overseeing all SCA functions and playing a central role in the corporate functions of our entertainment businesses. She has also been an essential advisor to Kaz and Tokyo senior management.

We are very excited about this new management model, which reaffirms Sony's focus on and commitment of resources to growth in our Entertainment business.

I want to thank Nicole for her leadership and her dedication to Sony’s future. Please join me in congratulating her today.

Sincerely,

Michael Lynton

CEO, Sony Entertainment
Chairman and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment
