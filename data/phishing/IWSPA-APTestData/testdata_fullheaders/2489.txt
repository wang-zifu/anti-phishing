ProgressNow affiliates don't ask for domain.com, but I'm going to brag just a
little...

This is the kind of one-two punch ProgressNow is well known for (at least
among the hyperinformed crowd). This is also a GREAT example of
how successfully produce a win via localization of message (CO - where we
are fighting a personhood amendent for the 3rd time in 6 years, but we win
by 40+ points on personhood in CO).

Two stories are dominating the CO press around the Ryan domain.com:

Looks like the vetting process for Paul Ryan events isn't too strict.

Someone forwards along a picture of 'Fertilized Egg' being admitted to
Ryan's event in Lakewood, Colo.

It's, of course, a reference to Ryan's position on fetal personhood =97 and
his support for the  Sanctity of Human Life Act, which defined fertilized
eggs as a human being.

Paul Ryan Gosling Quotes Flown Over Rally for Actual Paul Ryan
 *Erin Gloria Ryan*

<<<link>>>Since
Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney announced that he was choosing
Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate, all meme hell has
broken loose. He looks like Eddie Munster! The American people are
unimpressed *and so is McKayla Maroney*! But, most importantly, his last
name is the same as the first name of Ryan Gosling, arguably the most
successfully memed celebrity on the domain.com. In fact, Paul Ryan Gosling, the
Paul Ryan/Ryan Gosling meme lovechild, has made an appearance via an
airplane banner flown over a Paul Ryan rally earlier today. "Hey girl,"
read the banner, "choose me, lose choice."

CNBC's Eamon James
Tweeted<<<link>>>
about
the banner sighting above a Ryan campaign event in Colorado, which was full
of people completely convinced that they'd never get sick, or be poor, or
not want to be pregnant.

Ryan didn't respond to the aggressive Hey Girl-ing he just received,
presumably because he was too busy friending zygotes on Facebook.
