            Come Together for Kidney Research!



 The holidays are a special time to count our blessings, reconnect with the important people in our lives, and come together. As we think back on the history of UKRO, we are very proud of the progress we've made with your continued support, and offer a special thanks to those who supported our gala dinner in September. We are all part of an amazing organization!



And we have important work to do. We still need to raise more funds for the USC/UKRO Kidney Research Center (KRC). That's why we are asking you to come together for kidney research, show your support, give more if you can, and spread the word about UKRO. Here are some ways you can help.
Please donate now and consider making a recurring gift to UKRO this year. Your gift will help launch the KRC, bringing hope to millions of kidney patients and their families waiting for a much-needed cure.
Please consider gifts in conjunction with estate planning and in honor of birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, memorial tributes, and other occasions of importance.
Come together on Facebook and Twitter. Like us, follow us, share your stories with us, and let your social networks know you're committed to kidney research. Use the hashtags #cometogether, #kidneyresearch, and #charity and tweet to us @ukrocharity.
  Many thanks for your generosity over the years and may you all have a joyful holiday and a healthy and fabulous 2015!



With best wishes
from everyone at UKRO,



Ken Kleinberg,
President, UKRO 



Natalie Cole
