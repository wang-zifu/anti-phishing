Dear Colleagues,
As you know we launched the Center on Privacy and Technology approximately 
a year ago with the intent of providing a training ground for Georgetown La
w students to become leaders in privacy practice, policymaking and advocacy
 while bringing Georgetown Law=92s legal expertise to bear on privacy debat
es in federal and state legislatures. The Center is doing just that and, un
der the direction of the Executive Director Alvaro Bedoya and the Center=92
s Faculty Directors. it is expanding its voice to preserve privacy and civi
l liberties within the =93Big Data=94 debate and other areas where public p
rivacy and civil liberties intersect with new technologies. In the 2015-16 
academic year the Center will be increasing the number of fellows involved 
in this mission.

To enable this expansion, this summer we will be repurposing the Faculty Re
ading Room (McDonough 444) to accommodate Alvaro and four other Center staf
f members.  We recognize the impact that this change will have with regard 
to space for faculty members. Faculty will continue to find coffee and tea 
options in Faculty Support (McDonough 475) and in the kitchen area outside 
of the Faculty Lounge (McDonough 520). The books and newspapers currently l
ocated in the Faculty Reading Room will be temporarily relocated to bookcas
es across from the elevators located on the west side of the 4th floor of M
cDonough Hall. Once new bookcases arrive, the Reading Room collection will 
be permanently relocated  to the Faculty Lounge on the 5th floor of McDonou
gh Hall.

We anticipate that this repurposing will begin shortly with the bookcases a
nd other furniture being removed from Room 444 in order to prepare the domain.com
e for its new purpose. We appreciate your support and understanding as we a
ttempt to find workable solutions to our space constraints.

Best,
Bill
