If the objective is purely to undermine the Benghazi hearings, I think
these spots will certainly help do that.  But if the objective is to
connect emails-Benghazi and conflate the two in voters=E2=80=99 minds (whic
h
consultants feel is an imperative here), I=E2=80=99m not sure we know wheth
er we
can credibly do that =E2=80=93 we=E2=80=99ll get a read from groups, but ma
y need to just
make a judgement call once we see rough cuts.

Maybe I=E2=80=99m on my own here, but fwiw: I fully heard what HRC was sayi
ng, and
understand the case for doing this =E2=80=93 but I think it would be a mist
ake to
pull down the spots we just went up with in IA/NH and make the entire
dialogue about scandal/hearings/email.  We=E2=80=99d be closing off the one
 clean
avenue we have to communicate her message and our data shows that is giving
us a lift.  At the very least, would mix a new spot in and keep at least
one of the newly-launched spots up =E2=80=93 so that this isn=E2=80=99t the
 ONLY thing
voters are hearing for the next 2-3 weeks.

I am for IA and NH.  I know the boss wants a national cable buy to reach
the inside the beltway types, press and donors.  But press will hate this.
We will lose ground with them because of it.  (I am still for doing it).
Actual voters should see and see before the hearing.

Let's def discuss when we review scripts but I think we gotta do this in IA
and Nh.  Our thesis is that our stuff doesn't cut through as well because
it doesn't intersect w the crap they hear about her on the news.  I feel
like this is the kinda stuff we need to do to actually move numbers right
now.

At least worth trying this month.  If numbers don't move then we can go
back to plan A.
