We’re really happy Bob…..film has delivered LC$1.615 mill…..that’s 23% up on HOTEL T…..which was a great success here as you know !

It’s also 5% above the original CLOUDY  as well…..and have no worries about passing that films cume !

(This is also not counting paid previews of over $235K !) Cume is over LC$1.85 million….

Nothing but good times ahead…..some private schools on holidays now…..so modest mid-week biz. and then all schools at end of week…

FROZEN doesn’t come into market until Dec. 23….and we’ll play thru Xmas & New Year ….and pick up heaps of biz.




We’re really happy Bob….so should you be….CONGRATS. to us all I say !

CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 earned an estimated $4.1 million overseas raising its total to $102.7 million.




In a prime spot, one week ahead of school vacations, Australia bowed  with $1.7 million, bigger than the opening of CLOUDY 1, and New Zealand  opened to $.215, 20% over the opening of CLOUDY 1.  




 South Korea took in another $.435 in its 3rd frame bringing its total to $4.2.  Israel earned $.225 for a total of $1.1 and Argentina did $.185 (cume $3.2).  




Next major opening is Spain on December 20.
