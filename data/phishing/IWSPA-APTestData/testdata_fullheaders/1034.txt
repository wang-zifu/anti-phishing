Hey friends:

It's your weekly reminder (I'm tenacious that way) :)

Many of you already gave again to me in the runoff, so feel free to hit
"delete" if you have already and thank you!

For those that haven't, it is really simple--if we can get everyone that
gave in the first round of the mayor's race to give again, we will have the
resources to communicate our message and we will win. Please give $1300 to
ensure we take our 1st place showing on March 5th into the May 21st runoff.
*Do it now at <<link>>*

This last week was amazing--full of momentum and the real, on-the-ground
endorsements that can help deliver a campaign.  Four of my current and
future colleagues with proven electoral records and great political
operations endorsed me, from the Valley to the Westside to San Pedro.  We
had a great fundraising swing through the East Coast, where folks were
buzzing about the race and excited to support me.

You may be waiting to come to an event--don't let that stop you from
donating now--*you are welcome to come to all and any future events and I
have cced Stephanie Smith on this (just let her know and she will send you
a list).*

But I need you--here's the link again to donate up to $1300.  There is a
3-1 match for donations, so your money multiplies when you give it. *Please
do so now at: <<link>>*

Thank you and talk to you soon.

Let's go win this.

Eric
