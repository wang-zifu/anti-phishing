John -

My father was at Panera=B9s today on Wisconsin yesterday and saw you run by
while reading about HRC's van trip and texted me right away =8B he felt very
close to the campaign!

I=B9ve been in touch with Huma and JD and others over the last few months
about helping in whatever way I can.  You=B9re about the busiest guy in the
world, I know, so will keep this brief, but if you need help in any way, le
t
me know.  I=B9m working for a VC firm, but if I could help you in any way kee
p
the trains running on time and keeping the various balls of the campaign in
the air, I would gladly join the campaign.  I=B9m not a political hack, but I
am a known entity and pretty good at a lot of different things.  Anyway,
throwing it out there on the off chance any of this resonates with what you
need to do your job.

And either way, congrats on the role, and I=B9m sure I will see you around in
the coming months.

All the best,

Joe
