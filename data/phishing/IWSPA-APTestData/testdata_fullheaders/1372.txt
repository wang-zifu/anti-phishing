Quote from User for Bloomberg on Trump perhaps deciding to take campaign contributions. Wanted to tie it into the temperament argument though this might be a bit much. Thanks for the feedback.

"This is further evidence that you never know where Trump will be on any given issue on any given day, whether that's on the economy, on foreign policy or his campaign itself. Trump's inconsistency and unpredictability is just another reason he lacks the temperament to occupy the Oval Office."
