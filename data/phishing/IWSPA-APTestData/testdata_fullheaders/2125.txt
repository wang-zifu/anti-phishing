It's a girl!! and what else is new in Chocolandia...

Dear Friends,

It's been quite a while since my last newsletter and I am so thrilled to report that on August 11, 2013, I gave birth to
the most beautiful baby girl, at our home in Asheville! Her name is Perseia Pele-Rose, born 2 1/2 weeks before her due date

 <<link>>
during the Peseid meteor shower, and she is the embodiment of our prayers...

Our hearts are so filled with joy and gratitude as we navigate this new reality of parenthood and celebrate
this next phase of our lives!!

And in the meantime, Silvermoon Chocolate has been full speed ahead right up until the day she surprised us...and got
right back into gear as soon as I was back on my feet again...And Asheville has definitely embraced us with open arms,
and sure does love Medicine Balls!!  Our products are now carried at about 8 retail locations as well as various famer's markets!

Phew!!! Somedays I feel like superwoman, as I care for my beloved new daughter, run a growing business, make dinner,
and have a few moments to catch up with my full-time Traditional Chinese medical student husband...and other days I am a sleep
deprived, emotional, over-worked mama, longing to get away for a few hours and go to a yoga class or get a massage!!
Overall, loving the dance, so ridiculously in love with my girl, and learning soooooo much....i had no idea ;)

 <<link>>

So, I hope all is well in your world, and that you are finding joy in the simple things as we prepare for the upcoming
holiday season!!
And if you would like to give a unique, delicious, and healthy treat as a gift this time around, we are here for you!!

Just please get your orders in as early as possible so as to ensure they will arrive on time!!

many many blessings and so much love from our family to yours!!

Arad
