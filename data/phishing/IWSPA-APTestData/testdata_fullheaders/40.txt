Hi -
This is a DRAFT with all the states, but Ollie and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss it more detail.

See attached sample report. You can view this report within Salesforce by heading into the Reports tab, clicking the Surrogate Operations folder and by selecting the 'Surrogate Report by Person' report.

Hi -
Attached is a Surrogate Report By Person (template).
The goal is to read up on each person we have by state and surrogate type.
We need it for each state, but is there a template we can "sort" through the fields?
Call me if you want to discuss - or we need to discuss prioritizing it with Andrew.
I'm working from home today.
Thanks.
