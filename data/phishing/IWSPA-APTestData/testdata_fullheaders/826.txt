Struts 1.1: Should I Upgrade? 

By John Yu

Built on the success of Struts 1.0, Struts 1.1 beta was released in March this year and showcased at JavaOne 2002. This article describes the new features found in Apache Struts 1.1 beta and the impact of migration from Struts 1.0 to Struts 1.1. It also offers advice on the migration decision and the upgrade process.

Senior Staff Engineer, Java Software, Sun Microsystems 




In this interview, Amy talks about the problems JavaServer Faces (JSF) solves and how J2EE developers can leverage it in their Web apps. She looks at UI components used in JSF, the implementation of event handling code, and describes a typical use case involving JSF. She also discusses interoperability with JSF using Struts, Webwork, and the Portlet API.

Floyd Marinescu to co-teach J2EE Patterns - Sept 16, Dallas 

Dear TSS Members,

I thought you'd be interested to know that The Middleware Company has created a J2EE Patterns training course that I will be co-teaching in Dallas during the week of September 16th. The course combines and improves upon the best J2EE design patterns material available in my book EJB Design Patterns, Sun's Core Patterns, TheServerSide's patterns repository and others. 

I have just reviewed the final material and I am very excited with the end product. This class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. One of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications, including domain.com. 

I highly recommend this course to the seasoned J2EE developer who wants to master the cutting edge in J2EE architecture and design. 

If you'd like to register for the course, simply click here:

Sincerely, 

Floyd Marinescu 
Author, EJB Design Patterns 
Director of domain.com J2EE Community

New Patterns 




  iXML Pattern   



   By Venkatesh Balakumar   




In due course, we will be finding ourselves in the middle of Web services, which will granulate into representing all data in XML. For preparing and implementing Web services, it's necessary to express all data in XML. This pattern does the same.

Read more on this pattern. 

 Widget Pages   



   By Guilherme Silva   




This pattern allows for using XMLC and Barracuda without exposing their APIs to widget users. In fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time, which is ideal for migrating or upgrading. 

Read more on this pattern.

 JRun 4.0 - Good Stuff    



   By Jason McKerr   




Some general impressions I had of JRun: It's very easy to get it up and running.  
Allaire-now-Macromedia has always had one of my favorite servlet engines. 
The Java Management Console (web-based admin interface) has gotten a tonne better.  
It's dead easy to plug into just about any IDE (I've done it with JBuilder Enterprise 6, and the Intellij IDEA EAP (Builds 640 -642). 
The JSP compiler is smokin! Very, very fast. I think it must come with Jikes or something.

Java Server Faces Public Draft and Early Access Available 




The public draft of the JavaServer Faces 1.0 Specification has been published, as well as an early access download of the API's and tag library. JSF is a web application framework that reduces the amount of code needed to write a web front end. Developers need only write JSF components and corresponding event handling code, the framework then simplifies the tasks of validation, request parameter parsing, state management, multipe clients support, etc.

Meta Group: J2EE Complexity Holding Back Platform Adoption




The Meta Group has released a research report saying that the relative complexity of doing server-side development using J2EE is hurting adoption of the platform. Among other predictions are the continuing dominance of BEA and IBM, more consolidation, and increasing vendor competition in tools and frameworks.

IBM nudges back release of WebSphere 5.0




IBM has rescheduled its release of J2EE 1.3 certified Websphere Application Server 5 from September to late November, saying it "reprioritized" its schedule in order to release Websphere Studio 5 first - a break from the usual order of releases.
