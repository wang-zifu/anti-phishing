This was updated based on our conversation and I'm not sure I understand wh
at you're asking us to shift to, so if you want to send along a better set 
of actual bullets/points to work into our framing i think that would help. 
But if it's something that elevates Ryan, I don't expect we could get state
 parties to adopt it because it would hurt them in other races.

No. We had a whole back and forth on this exact subject where you made the 
exact arguments you're making now.

Our conversation on Wednesday was about driving the wedge between Paul Ryan
 and Donald Trump, where Paul Ryan had trouble with his muslim ban and depo
rtation squad etc... and that he would have to cave in order to get to Trum
p's position.  Short of that: just sticking with the general disunity theme
 and chaos in the Republican party, staying out of policy. That's what you 
agreed to do on the 1:30pm call yesterday. That's what I informed our campa
ign that you would be doing. We specifically talked about how we don't want
 to tie them together just yet or talk about the Ryan-Trump agenda.
