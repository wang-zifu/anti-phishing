John -




I know you are busy as heck so I appreciate your taking a moment to read
this email and put it in a file for future use.




I emailed Leslie Kean ten days ago but have not received any response.




Based on significant personal experience, I can attest that UFO hunters are
looking in the wrong places.




Random personal observations, fuzzy photographers, and crop circles will
never "prove" the existence of anything, especially since UFO appearances to
humans are transitory and somewhat related to the observer's state of mind.




What needs to be collected and publicly disseminated is hard scientific data
collected from instruments that are known to be accurate and reliable.




Within the US, this information has existed for many years and is still
available today, if one knows "where to look"  and "what to look for."  




Radar data and thermal imaging data is a good start, especially if one knows
the flight envelope and maneuvering characteristics of a UFO.




If/when you might be interested  in gaining more specific information
(program names) please feel free to contact me by email to arrange a phone
call or meeting (I live in northern Cal but occasionally travel to DC for
business activities)!




While I am publicly known by my work with the USS domain.com Museum, this
communication with you is entirely PRIVATE and CONFIDENTIAL and has nothing
to do with the museum.




Regards,




Bob Fish

Danville, CA
