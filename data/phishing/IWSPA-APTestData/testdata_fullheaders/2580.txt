I was up around 4am thinking about all of this. It might premature al together to have this Marketing/Production(lol) before Josh gets here. Also wondering how fiscally responsible it is to do before April. Which leads me to think we just change up Cancun a bit and have it there. 
Thoughts?

Paula,
Do you want to send around a note to the creative team that we are postponing or would you like me to handle?
