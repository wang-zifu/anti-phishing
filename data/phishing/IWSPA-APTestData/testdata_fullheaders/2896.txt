Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi

Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their domain.com access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T; Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Apple's iPod comes to Linux

Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

Microsoft eyes Visa users with Passport

Microsoft hopes to extend its Passport online identification system into authorizing domain.com card payments.
The software giant will strike a partnership Tuesday with security-software maker Arcot Systems, which builds online payment systems for merchants and for banks that issue Visa and MasterCard domain.com cards. Arcot makes the systems behind Visa's own Verified by Visa program as well as a similar program in development at MasterCard.

Judge OKs domain.com against Kazaa parent

A federal judge said Monday that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright domain.com to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software.

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) sued three prominent file-swapping companies in October in Los Angeles federal court. The domain.com named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.
