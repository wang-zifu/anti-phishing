Dear John,

Doubling down =E2=80=A6 and "running scared" =E2=80=A6 that's Congressman T
oomey in a nutshell!

As the Delco Times, one of our state's leading newspapers, said "Judging fr
om the negative direction in which Toomey has already taken his campaign, i
t appears he does not have confidence in his own ability to beat Sestak in 
November."

Last week, Congressman Toomey (and two special-interest groups) tried to bl
unt our upward momentum - - reflected in the Quinnipiac Poll that showed us
 having made up 8 points in three months; the race tied; and Quinnipiac's p
ollster concluding the Senate race was "wide open" - - by launching 7 decep
tive, negative "attack ads" across the state.

We asked for your help to respond, and you did so, tremendously!

Today, we've learned Congressman Toomey is "doubling down" and has purchase
d an additional week of negative TV ads for $250,000.  We are asking you to
 please step forward, and make a contribution of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250,
 whatever you are able to afford, to help us respond!

As the Delco Times said in its editorial, "Toomey Turns to Attack Tactics":

"Enduring election ads is enough of an ordeal.  Having to endure them a ful
l four months before the general election is downright torturous.

Add the fact that they are attacking an opponent instead of promoting a can
didate's platform makes them all the more aggravating. Nevertheless, that's
 the tack Pat Toomey has chosen to take. ...

Last week, Toomey launched a TV ad campaign featuring five commercials. Fou
r 15-second spots directly attack Sestak. A fifth 30-second ad criticizes t
he Democratic Party in general...

What is puzzling about Toomey's approach is that he chose to go negative at
 all, much less early in July.

=E2=80=A6 One would think he would have his own record to stand on in engin
eering his campaign strategy.

Immediately going for the jugular suggests someone running scared =E2=80=A6

Judging from the negative direction in which Toomey has already taken his c
ampaign, it appears he does not have confidence in his own ability to beat 
Sestak in November."

With no platform to present to the voters and a past record of supporting t
he disastrous Bush agenda, Congressman Toomey - - a right-wing ideologue - 
- is "running scared" because of the momentum we've demonstrated and the ca
mpaign operation we are building and extending throughout Pennsylvania.

When your opponent is "running scared =E2=80=A6 [and] it appears he does no
t have confidence in his own ability to beat Sestak in November" =E2=80=A6 
that is when a contribution NOW can be so critical - to keep the pressure o
n - as our strategy is to win in the summer, so that we dominate in the fal
l!

Please make a contribution to help us push-back against this upcoming week 
of negative attacks.

Your contributions last week allowed us to bring on-line several new office
s; we'd like to bring several more new offices on-line this week as well.

We are 15 weeks out from election day =E2=80=A6 let's keep Congressman Toom
ey "running scared"!

Best regards,
Rich Sestak
Campaign Director
