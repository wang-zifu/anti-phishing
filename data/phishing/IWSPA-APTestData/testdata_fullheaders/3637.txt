Hi April,

Need to chat briefly about the ASDC meeting tomorrow in Philadelphia.

Alex Seitz-Wald from NBC and Gabe Debenedetti from Politico are both planning to attend for some part of the gathering. If at least some parts of the gathering are not closed and those two plan to be there (but are still waiting for details), then I think we have to advise those things that are open, right? But, we'd need to do so soon.

Thanks again,
Mark
