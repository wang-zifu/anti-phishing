      Gov. Kasich promised to bring good jobs to Ohio but he's bringing too
 many
   [1]low-wage jobs.

   He's trying to give millionaires more [2]tax cuts, but just took away
   [3]collective bargaining rights that could lead to pay cuts for home care
   and childcare workers.

   Please help these workers advocate for their families and clients, and
   help Ohio preserve quality care and services to children, seniors and
   people with disabilities.

   Call Gov. Kasich at 614-466-3555 and tell him to restore the rights he
   stripped from these workers.

   Ohio deserves better.

   Sincerely,
   Sandy Theis, ProgressOhio
