Dear Chairman,
Good seeing you in Chicago the other day at Parliament, and thank you for s
peaking with Maureen Pikarski about ethnic outreach.
Question: I would like to know it's okay to send you a rather lengthy email
 of loving critiques/feedback that has some urgency to it. =C2=A0I hesitate
, because I would hate for anything I email you to reflect poorly or seem a
ssociated with the HRC Super Volunteers...this is just my feedback as donor
, a long time supporter and organizer.=C2=A0
Is that okay? =C2=A0
I know you are so very busy, but I would prefer this to go just to you if t
hat is okay.
Many thanks as always.
