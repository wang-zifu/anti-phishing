Hi,

I wanted to know if you would like to be my guest at the Commonwealth of
San Francisco's event Women Seeking Success and Reforms, which I will be
one of the presenters/panelists. This event will mostly focus on women in
the Middle East (not that Afghanistan is considered the Middle East).

It will be at noon on Friday, June 5th at 555 Post St. San Francisco, CA.

I would love to have you as my guest and can arrange for your name to be on
the list.

Please let me know if you would like to be there.
