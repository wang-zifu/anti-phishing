Re: from a. sorkin

Aaron,

Many thanks for the note.  (And thanks for your comment about Mr. Moritz!)  I am not aware of any kerfuffle.   I think that the screenplay you have written is tremendous and I am very eager to have the opportunity to discuss it with you.  The gratitude is all mine for having you as the author of it!  Looking forward to talking and to the premiere.

Warmly,

Michael
