FULL PREPARED REMARKS
Thank you all very much. I appreciate the warm welcome to Pennsylvania, and
the hospitality of Montgomery County Community College.

Tomorrow will be the third and final presidential debate, and just 21 days
-- who's counting?-- remain until Americans choose their next president.
Over the last 21 days, we have seen once-sturdy Wall Street institutions
vanish, we have seen huge swings in the market both down and up, and we have
seen new federal commitments in the hundreds, hundreds of billions of
dollars. We have seen how suddenly a crisis can unfold these last several
weeks, and how great the costs can be in jobs, savings, lost opportunity and
taxpayer's dollars. What we need to see now is swift and bold action to lead
this country in a new direction. [cheers]

If I am elected president, I will help to create jobs for Americans in the
most effective way a president can do this -- with tax cuts that are
directed specifically to create jobs, and protect your life savings. I will
stand up to the corrupt ways of Washington, the wasteful spending and the
abuses of power and I will end these abuses, whatever it takes. I will lead
reforms to help families keep their homes, and retirees to keep their
savings, and college students to pay their tuition, and every citizen to
afford health care, and America to reclaim its energy independence. We'll
drill offshore and we'll drill now. These will be my priorities. We cannot
spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting
for our luck to change. The hour is late and our troubles are getting worse.
We have to act immediately. We have to change direction now. We have to
fight. We have to fight for America. And we must fight now.

This is what we have to do. That is what I will do in my term as president,
and when I leave office I can promise you that this nation will not be on
the same path it is today. I will not play along with the same Washington
games and gimmicks [yelling] that got us into this terrible mess in the
first place. [cheers] I am going to Washington to fight for you.

I will begin by making certain that the 700 billion dollars already
committed to economic recovery is not used to further enrich the very people
and institutions that invited these troubles with their own reckless
conduct. Instead of just propping up institutions deemed "too big to fail"
in this crisis, we will use more of this public money to help businesses and
homeowners that may be too small to survive.

I know you know, This financial crisis started with our housing crisis, and
we cannot fix our markets and the economy until we fix the housing crisis.
My plan will protect the value of your home and get it rising again by
buying up bad mortgages and refinancing them so if your neighbor defaults he
doesn't bring down the value of your house with him. I will direct the
government to refinance troubled mortgages for homeowners and replace them
with mortgages they can afford. This is what we did during the Great
Depression and we can do it again. Helping families who face default,
foreclosure, and possible bankruptcy helps all homeowners, and will begin
the process of recovery from this crisis. With so much on the line, the
moment requires that government act -- and as president I intend to act,
quickly and decisively.

When the government does [not] provide funds to shore up companies, the
terms will be demanding, there will be complete transparency and the safety
net for our financial system will not become a golden parachute for failed
executives. Moreover, we will not merely inject billions of dollars into
companies and walk away hoping for the best. We will require that those
companies be reformed and restructured until they are sound assets again,
and can be sold at no loss -- or perhaps even a domain.com -- to the taxpayers
of America.

And when that is accomplished, in each instance, government will relinquish
its interest in these private companies. We're going to get government out
of the business of bailouts and equity stakes, and back in the business of
responsible regulation. We will learn from this crisis to prevent the next
one, with much stricter oversight. No more wild overleveraging, no more
liabilities concealed from the public and from shareholders, no more
bundling of assets to maximize domain.com by assuming insane risks. Those days
are over on Wall Street. With new rules of public disclosure and accounting,
my reforms will make certain these betrayals of shareholders and the public
trust are never repeated.

We must restore trust to our financial system. On my orders, the Department
of the Treasury will guarantee one hundred percent of all savings accounts
for a period of six months. This will calm the understandable fears of
widespread bank failure, while also restoring rational judgment to the
choices of the market.

As president, I will also act to protect investors -- especially those
relying on their investments for retirement. [cheers] Current rules mandate
that investors must begin to sell off their IRAs and 401Ks when they reach
age 70 and one half years old. Those rules should be suspended to spare
senior citizens from being forced to sell their stock just as the market is
hurting the most. Under the emergency measure I propose, we will also cut
the tax rate for withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts from
five to ten percent. Retirees have suffered enough and need relief, and the
surest relief is to let them keep more of their own savings.

It is essential that we avoid an exodus of capital from the market.
Senator Obama
yesterday offered up a proposal that would have the effect of encouraging
early withdrawal of funds from 401(k) accounts, by suspending penalties
through 2009. This is an invitation to capital flight, and therefore to
continued instability in the market, at a moment when exactly the opposite
is needed. Any family that takes part in this will not see the benefits of
the market recovery that smart policy can help bring about. In my
administration, we will instead revive the market by attracting new
investment. I will cut in half the capital gains tax on stocks purchased
[cheers] and held for more than a year -- from a rate of 15 to 7.5
percent.This vital measure will promote buying, raise asset values,
help companies
and shore up the pensions plans for workers and retirees.

We should also not penalize Americans who are forced to sell investments in
today's tough markets. [hooray!] I will increase the amount of capital
losses from $3,000 to $15,000, which can be deducted from your ordinary
income in tax years 2015 and 2009. [cheers] So much of this decline in our
markets and value destruction was due to the failure of Congress and the
Administration to come out with a timely rescue package. Investors are
always responsible for their investment decisions, but the hard earned
savings of Americans should not be penalized by the erratic behavior of
politicians.

It will not be enough for the federal government to correct the excesses of
Wall Street without reforming its own reckless practices.

Spending in Washington is out of control and I am going to rein it in. As
president, I will veto the pork barrel special interest projects that are
wasting your tax dollars, driving up our debt, and weakening our dollar. I
have proposed a one year spending freeze with certain exceptions for such
things as defense and veteran care. We are going to use that year to turn
Washington inside out and get rid of wasteful, inefficient programs that do
no one any good.

While we put government back on your side, we must reform our tax system to
deliver needed tax relief to working Americans, and to create jobs. I will
double the child deduction, from 3,500 dollars to 7,000 dollars. Every
person in America who chooses it will receive a 5,000 dollars towards the
purchase of health insurance -- health plans that will be theirs to keep,
even if they change jobs or move to another state. And we will reduce the
federal business tax rate from 35 percent -- the second-highest in the world
-- to 25 percent. I am also proposing today that for those who are between
jobs, we eliminate all taxes on unemployment benefits. It is unclear to me
why the government taxes money it has just sent you, [crowd laughs, cheers]
and we should relieve this burden from Americans who've been hit the
hardest.

Reducing business tax rates has the potential to stop and reverse the rise
of unemployment, and could create millions of new jobs. Despite the frequent
changes to my opponent's tax plans in recent months -- he seems to revise
them with each new poll -- his plan to raise taxes on 50% of small business
income has survived. [boos] And even as he rails against companies that shut
down their plants and move overseas, he refuses to cut the tax rate that
drives many of these companies away.

A typical middle-class family of four making 42,000 dollars a year with
health insurance will get 4,350 more dollars under my plan than they would
under Senator Obama's plan. That example of 42,000 a year in wages is
especially relevant, because just last year Senator Obama voted to raise
taxes on individuals making that amount. [boos]

Senator Obama is also the same fellow who requested a million dollars a day
in pork barrel earmarks [boos, yelling] ... who thinks that wasting 18
billion dollars a year in earmarks is not worth worrying about, who proposed
a near doubling of the taxes on dividends and capital gains during the
primary, who has voted 94 times for tax increases or against tax cuts, who
is promising almost a trillion dollars in new spending, [boos] who came to
the Senate a few years ago and already earned the title of its most liberal
member [boos] -- this is the man who now presents himself as a tax cutter
and champion of middle-class America. [boos, yelling]

He is an eloquent speaker, but even he can't turn a record of supporting
higher taxes into a credible promise to cut taxes. What he promises today is
the opposite of what he has done his entire career. Perhaps never before in
history have the American people been asked to risk so much based on so
little.

You can look at the record of what he's done or you can just go with your
gut, but either way you're left with the same conclusion: Senator Obama is
going to raise your taxes. And in this economy, raising taxes is the surest
way to turn a recession into a depression.

Senator Obama also promises to restrict international trade and risk access
to foreign markets for American goods and services. The last President to
raise taxes and restrict trade in a bad economy was Herbert Hoover. That
didn't turn out to well. They say those who fail to learn the lessons of
history are doomed to repeat them. Well, I know my history lessons, [crowd
roars] and I sure won't make the mistakes Senator Obama will. And were my
opponent elected with a Democratic Congress in power, not only would there
be no check on my opponent's reckless economic policies, there would be
considerable pressure on him to tax and spend even more.

This weekend, a plumber concerned that Senator Obama was going to raise his
taxes asked him directly about his plan. The response was telling. Senator
Obama explained to him that he was going to raise his taxes to quote "spread
the wealth around." [boos, yelling] This explains how Senator Obama can
promise an income tax cut for millions who aren't even paying income taxes
right now. My friends, my plan isn't intended to force small businesses to
cut jobs to pay higher taxes so we can "spread the wealth around."
[grumbling] My plan is intended to create jobs and increase the wealth of
all Americans.

My plan for economic recovery does not require guesswork or blind faith from
the American people. [yelling] You know my record. You don't have to hope I
will do what I promise. When I say I will cut spending, you need only look
at my record to know it's true. When I say I will defend taxpayers, you know
it's true because it's what I've always done. When I say I will work across
the aisle, you can see it in the results I've delivered.

And when I say I will change Washington, you know I'll do it, [cheers - USA!
USA!] because for me change isn't a political slogan, it's what I've been
doing my whole career.

I know you're worried. America is a great country, but we are at a moment of
national crisis that will determine our future. [someone yells "We need
you!"] Will we continue to lead the world's economies or will we be
overtaken? Will the world become safer or more dangerous? Will our military
remain the strongest in the world? Will our children and grandchildren's
future be brighter than ours?

My answer to you is yes. Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we
will be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better
country. But we must be prepared to act swiftly, boldly, with courage and
wisdom. [yelling, laughter]

I know what fear feels like. It's a thief in the night who robs your
strength.

I know what hopelessness feels like. It's an enemy who defeats your will.

I felt those things once before. I will never let them in again. I'm an
American. And I choose to fight. [crowd chants John McCain! john mccain!]

Don't give up hope. Be strong. Have courage. And fight.

Fight for a new direction for our country.

Fight for what's right for America.

Fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness [crowd
roars] in Washington.

Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead.

Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.

Fight for our children's future.

Fight for justice and opportunity for all.

Stand up to defend our country from its enemies. [cheers]

Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for.
Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never domain.com. We never hide
from history. We make history.

Now, let's go win this election and get this country moving again. [crowd
roars]
