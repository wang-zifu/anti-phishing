Senate Majority Leader Weinberg Issues Statement on Governor Christie's Elevated Role in the Donald Trump Campaign

Trenton- Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg released the following statement in response to the announcement that Governor Christie would serve as transition chair in a hypothetical Trump administration:

"Despite suspending his failed presidential campaign, it appears that our governor will continue to travel around the country at the expense of New Jersey taxpayers focused on anything and everything but the job he was actually elected to do. I am calling on Governor Christie to disclose how much his travel will cost our state. Not only is he currently drawing a taxpayer salary for a job he does not do, he has the audacity to make us to foot the bill for his self-serving political agenda."
