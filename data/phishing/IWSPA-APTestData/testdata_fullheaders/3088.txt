Subject: A Column

I am doing a column about Sony to appear early in January and, in

years past, we always had an off the record discussion before I wrote

anything (I hate to do the arithmetic, but we have a twenty-year

precedent on this!)  Now I  realize that things are more complex these

days, that a new pr head is in place etc,  so I understand completely

if you break precedent this time and choose not to talk, but in view

of the past I wanted to alert you to my assignment.  Again, if we

talked, it would be a talk that never took place.

I much enjoyed the Bette Midler show and I know we both knew Sue very

well.  Very, very well.  Good seeing you guys there.
