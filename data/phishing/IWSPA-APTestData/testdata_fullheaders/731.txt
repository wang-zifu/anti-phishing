Hello sir,

How are you feeling? I heard you had your second surgery last week but are
already back at it.

Our vacation to Rome/Vatican and Florence is coming up at the end of next
week. I know you were just there, so any recommendations would always be
appreciated.

On another note, I don't think I gave you my cell. I wanted to make sure
you had it if/when we can continue our discussion on other matters ...
518-281-2738.

Talk soon,

user
