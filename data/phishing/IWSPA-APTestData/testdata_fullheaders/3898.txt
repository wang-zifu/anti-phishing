Dear Valued Customer : 
   We recently have   determined that different computers have logged in your Bank of America Online   Banking account, and multiple password failures were present before the logons.   We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us. If this is not   completed by April 11, 2007, we will be forced to suspend your account   indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for   your cooperation in this manner. In order to confirm your Online Bank records,   we may require some specific information from you.

To restore your account,   please Sign in to Online Banking.

thank you for using Bank Of America Online Service. 

Your account   might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive   payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds. To   lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your   username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification   process. You must confirm your domain.com card details and your billing information   as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed,   meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have   reactive your billing information on file. Sign in to Online Banking 

            Thank You. 

Please do not reply to   this message. If you have any questions about the information in this e-Bill,   please contact your biller. For all other questions, call us at   800-887-5749.
