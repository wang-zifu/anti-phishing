Some fumbling in this interview. I think he saw that last NBC/WSJ poll.

--

Can you win Indiana? Must win?

Indiana is critically. I was honored to receive the support of Governor Pen
ce. He's someone who Hoosiers support. He has a record of cutting taxes. On
 whether Indiana is a must win, Cruz says it's a critical state.

On the perception that getting the nomination on the second ballot would be
 stealing the nomination:

Nobody is going to clinch it on the first ballot. Donald Trump isn't either
. Says if you can't get a majority, you can't win.

Hits media for giving Trump free media. Calls Hillary and Trump flip sides 
of the same coin. Says they are both big government liberals

Trump's speech was a speech that reflected a weak and na=EFve view of forei
gn policy. Responding to praises of Trump's speech, Cruz hits Trump for say
ing he doesn't have a plan for ISIS. Also criticizes Trump for embracing th
e Iran deal.

Notes how he would re-implement sanctions on Iran that were working

On whether he's having fun, Cruz says he laughs every day and that he's run
ning a joyful campaign. Says he's a happy warrior.
