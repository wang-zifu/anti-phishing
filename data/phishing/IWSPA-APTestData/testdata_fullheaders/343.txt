 Eating Disorders: A Real Medical Illness, and Not Just for Women!




 Depiction Suggestions:  

The National Institutes of Health define an eating disorder as an illness that causes serious disturbances to your everyday diet, such as eating extremely small amounts of food or severely overeating. Eating disorders are a real medical illness, and can be treated. Eating disorders often coexist with other illness or diseases. These typically include depression, substance use, anxiety disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).

While eating disorders may seem to be focused on food and weight preoccupations, those who suffer with eating disorders try to use the control of food to cope with feelings and emotions.

The most common eating disorders are: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder, while body dysmorphic disorder, a mental illness is often associated with eating disorders.

Signs and symptoms of eating disorders include:

Extreme thinness (emaciation)

Intense fear of weight gain

Extremely restricting eating

Self-esteem overly related to body image

Shame and guilt

Withdrawal

Consider the following when exploring eating disorders in your storylines:

Signs and symptoms of eating disorders can present differently with each individual and may not be as noticeable as other illnesses. Think about ways you can depict how individuals experience these symptoms with eating disorders and the timeline as they progress with the disease.

Not just women are affected by eating disorders; men are as well. Consider showcasing a male with an eating disorder and how he is affected similarly and differently than females.

While there is no apparent cause of eating disorders, controlling food intake to cope with emotions and feelings plays a significant role in this illness. Try depicting individuals who may be experiencing other challenges like depression and bullying and how they are using eating disorders to counteract the effects of these issues.

Remember to explore the importance and availability of treatment and its ability to save an individual’s life.

Vincent Van Gogh stated (paraphrased), most succinctly, that we are not on the earth solely for our own happiness, we are here to realize great things for humanity. With that in mind, students from George Mason, Georgetown, California State and Chapman universities have teamed up to SPEAK Up about mental health. 

The social media-based SPEAK UP initiative seeks to demonstrate that general audiences will rally together to support common goals, like raising awareness of mental health.

Join the Cause!
