Hi, following up on this request on behalf of User. We'll need the desk removed by tomorrow before a new hire starts. Again I am happy to move it, I just need direction. Thanks for your time!

Hi Cliff! Just wanted to check on this. I'm happy to help move it, I just need guidance on where to bring it, and any sort of help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Hi Cliff! Sean in our communications pod had his last day today, and we would like to remove his desk (because he had 2). Could we do that today? Thanks!
