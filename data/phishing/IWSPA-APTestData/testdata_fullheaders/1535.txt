AH Q&A's Tonight

Tonight we had 2 American Hustle  screenings and Q&As with David, Bradley, Amy, and Jennifer participating in both. 

The first, at the Village, was for SAG Foundation.  The screening was 85% full, with a ton of enthusiasm.  Many attendants had already seen the film and were excited to see it again and see the cast together.  Pete Hammond did a great job of moderating the 20 minute conversation, and asked thought provoking and new questions.  

The second screening, at the Bruin, was attended by AMPAS, PGA, BAFTA, and SAG.  Applause for all participants during the announcement, and when the opening credits started to roll.  Again, about 85% full.  Great Q&A moderated by Scott Feinberg.  Jennifer was silly and thoughtful, and there was great back and forth amongst the four participants.

All together, 1,500 people saw the screenings and Q&As this afternoon - a fantastic turnout of guild and Academy members who have already received the screener.

Have a wonderful evening.
