Dear John,

Happy Labor Day! Before you start up that grill I wanted to draw your a
ttention to President Obama's announcement today that he will expand pa
id sick leave to employees of federal contractors=2E This is the right 
move and I applaud him for it=2E As a father of six, I know the pressur
e of choosing between work and family=2E For many Americans that choice
 is cruelly stark, too often choosing between taking care of their sick
 child and losing their job=2E A number of states and municipalities ha
ve implemented paid sick leave policies proving it can be done successf
ully=2E In Congress, I will be a strong leader in the fight for paid si
ck and maternity leave=2E Working with our friends in labor we can secu
re stronger protections for our families=2E

But until then, for today at least, I will be a strong leader in the fi
ght for that last burger from my five sons=2E

Hope you're having a great holiday weekend!

Glenn
