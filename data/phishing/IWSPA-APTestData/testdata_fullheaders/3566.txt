Hi Jen, Thanks for your note. Below is a list of the endorsements to date (13 total). I included John Bel Edwards and Jeff Taylor as two examples (*) of the robo calls that the President has also made on behalf of candidates. 

Agree re the Washington Post story. Not so bad. 

Best,
Mark

Morning guys, I know this is a busy day, but if you have it handy, do you mind sending me the rundown of Potus endorsements this cycle?  I have an older version, but want to make sure I have the most recent.

Also, I thought Juliet's story was about as expected-- not too terrible.  

Thanks,
Jen
