          Not all of us are born as naturally gifted at duelling as Professor Flitwick, and may need to practice our spells before becoming a duelling champion. So to help you on your way, we've written a new Guide to Duelling Club on domain.com, and we've even added some charming new spells for you to try.



          Wingardium Leviosa
    Cast the uplifting Levitation Charm and surprise your opponent.       



          Expelliarmus
    Disarm your opponent with this basic but extremely useful Charm.       



          Rictusempra
    Make your opponent giggle with the Tickling Charm.



          Immobulus
    Use the Freezing Charm to stop your rival in their tracks.       



          Master of Charms?
          Skillfully defeat your opponent using each of the new charms to be awarded our brand new Charming Dueller Badge.  



          Need a guiding hand?
          Swot up like Hermione and read our new Guide to Duelling Club to help you master a wizard's duel.
