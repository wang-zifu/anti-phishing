A short survey about your life that could change your life

Dear Amy,

I have never written you before with a specific request. I'm making one today:

Please fill out this assessment, titled "What is Your Quality of Life at Work?" We've spent many months putting together these questions in order to really understand your experience at work, and what has the potential to make it better.

As you know, The Energy Project is committed to changing the way the world works -- because we believe the way we're working isn't working. Over the coming weeks, along with my colleague Christine Porath, a professor at Georgetown University, I'll be feeding back to you in blogs what we learn from this survey.

We'll be able to tell you things like which factors at work most influence people's productivity and satisfaction; what qualities in managers and leaders drive the highest engagement and loyalty from employees; and what organizational policies and practices have the most powerful impact on people's life at work.

This survey should take you no more than 10 minutes. It's value could last you a lifetime.

Make waves,
user Schwartz
CEO
The Energy Project
