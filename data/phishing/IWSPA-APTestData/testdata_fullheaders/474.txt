Here is the most recent list of donors and prospects who have been invited 
to the conference.  Note: at the bottom are all the people Debby and I plac
ed on HOLD for now.  This does not include many of the new prospects we wan
t to include which Debby and I need to get together this week to discuss - 
so they can go out.

Let me know if either of you have any questions.

Hope you are having a Great Holiday!

Mary Pat
