Hi Ryan,

I'm a Reuters reporter working on a story today about the ongoing fallout from the events in Nevada this weekend. I have Rep. Wasserman Schultz's statement from yesterday, but I wanted to reach out to see if it would be possible to talk with the congresswoman for a  few minutes today about the conflict. Especially given Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver's remarks this morning about the congresswoman on CNN, I wanted to give her a chance to respond.

I'm sure you have seen it, but the most relevant part of the interview was this aspect:
"We can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz just about how she's been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning."
"It's not the DNC. By and large, people in the Organizationhave been good to us. Debbie Wasserman Schultz really is the exception."

I'm available by email or at the numbers below.
Many thanks,
Megan
