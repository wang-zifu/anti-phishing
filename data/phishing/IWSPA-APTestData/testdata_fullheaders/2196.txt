Hi all,

Next week, Dejuana Thompson starts in CE as the Deputy Director and the director of African American Outreach. We would like to host another check-in meeting with the CBC chiefs for next Tuesday or Wednesday to intro Dejuana and give a Organizationupdate (voter protection update, WH & DWS travel, CE plan and events, messaging update, diversity update and etc.) Please let me know if you (or someone from your team) is interested and available to attend the meeting.

Patrice and Julie - wanted to extend an invitation to you to attend and/or speak, if you'd like. No pressure.

Lemme know.

Marilyn D. Davis
National Director of Community Engagement
Organization
