                                                  Secondo me il mercato delle auto diventerà interessante. Saranno connesse, avranno android o siri for car (iOS), faranno intrattenimento, navigazione e qualcuna pure social sharing. E in fin dei conti le auto sono da sempre target delle forze dell'ordine. Basta ricordarsi delle storie di Macchiarella nel mettere le cimici sulle auto. L'installazione fisica è già un fatto "collaudato". Slashdot                            EU Secretly Plans To Put a Back Door In Every Car By 2015                                            An anonymous reader writes "A secretive EU body has agreed to develop a device to be fitted to all cars allowing police to cut off any engine at will, it emerged today. The device, which could be imposed within a decade, would also allow police to track a vehicle's movements as well as immobilise it. According to The Daily Telegraph a group of senior EU officials, including several Home Office mandarins, have signed off the proposal at a secret meeting in Brussels."<<link>>~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/ZrtyRklFmWI/story01.htmSent with Reeder--Alberto OrnaghiSoftware ArchitectSent from my mobile.
