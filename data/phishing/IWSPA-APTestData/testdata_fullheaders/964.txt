Our trust in government research shows how much people are feeling let down
by politicians, which is fueling a real antipathy to the political class.
In that world, I can understand the rise of Sanders and Trump -
anti-politicians to say the least.

Is it the assumption of the campaign not to worry about Sanders?  I'm
having a hard time understanding that so I thought I'd check in.
