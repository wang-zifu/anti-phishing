Subject: data collection and privacy - students

Data collection, usage, and privacy for students is a hot topic right now
for my district as well as others.  With common core and the new online
assessments school districts are implementing device programs for students,
and we're doing it fairly quickly.  How students are kept safe from the
data collectors and "profilers" is a real concern.

I'm eager to know if and how this is addressed at your data summits, or
elsewhere.  I'd be happy to provide input and perspective as a board
member, though you probably have a lot of voices already. In any event I'd
like to keep up with what's going on.

Thanks,
Megan
