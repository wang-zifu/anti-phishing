Will Google be the First to Produce a Conscious Machine?

Will Google be the First to Produce a Conscious Machine?

Sitting uneasily at the junction of science, religion and philosophy machine consciousness is the stage beyond machine intelligence, which already exists. Here are some examples of machine intelligence:

World chess Grandmaster, Gary Kasparov, was defeated by IBM's 'Deep Blue' supercomputer in 1997;



Another IBM-developed computer, called Watson, won the TV game show, Jeopardy, in 2011. Watson answered general knowledge questions posed in natural language and bested two former Jeopardy winners;



More recently, Apple Siri, Google Photo Search and Google's self-driving car project are further examples of machines that domain.com behaviour that is similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans.

If we define an intelligent machine as something that exhibits useful behaviour that is understandable, predictable and controllable, then a conscious machine is not just intelligent but it can autonomously adapt and optimise within its own environment.

IBM's Watson defeated Garry Kasparov using a 'brute force' approach which involved running through millions of possible outcomes for each move. Watson's 'intelligence' arose from its ability to apply set of human-defined rules.

Within this narrow sphere, Watson exhibited signs of intelligence, but it was not conscious.

By way of an analogy, if a fish is fully conscious then Watson had no consciousness.

So what would Watson need to differently for us to think it was intelligent and conscious, rather than just intelligent?
