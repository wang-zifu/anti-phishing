Ramona Otto's art in a new book

Hi Everyone,

A new book just came out this week called Never Stop to Think, Do I Have a Place For This by Mary Randolph Carter, the long time creative director of Ralph Lauren. The premise is what to do with collections. In my case, you can make art out of it. My chapter is 20 pages. Here is the description of the book.

A beautiful and inspiring volume, Never Stop to Think Do I Have a Place for This indulges our desire to surround ourselves with belongings that impart beauty and meaning to our lives. Delving into the interiors (and the collecting mindset) of real-life tastemakers (antique dealers, fashion designers, artists, boutique owners), Carter interviews the owners to reveal their personal stories and inspirations, and what drives their passion for collecting and, ultimately, how they manage to integrate their collections and interiors to live stylishly with their passions. The book showcases a range of personalities and styles, such as Heirloom Scavengers, anglophiles who collect beautiful housewares; The Preservationists, an artistic couple who collect and restore photographs; Scavenging the Evidence of Life, an artist who scavenges old photos, menus, and maps to use in his work; and The Queen of Muchness, an antique dealer known for having multiples of everything! A great read, Carter muses delightfully on the universal desire to acquire and collect, while imparting philosophy and tips for living creatively and integrating our passions into our decor.Lavishly illustrated with intimate photographs of 16 different homes and collections, this book exalts in the beauty of bounty and carries an inspiring message of how we can follow our passions to create a home we love.

If you have have oodles of free time, here is a video about the book/author that Carter just sent me.
