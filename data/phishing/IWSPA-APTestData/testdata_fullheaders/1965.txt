Dear John -

Every summer, hundreds of veterans head to Bristol Bay, Alaska to earn a 
living as commercial fishermen.

It's not easy work and it separates them from their families -- again -- 
but in this tough economy it pays well and takes care of things back home.

Unfortunately, two foreign mining companies with connections to the Koch 
Brothers are trying to dig a mine near the Bay that would destroy these 
jobs and lay waste to the environment.

So VoteVets wrote a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency and had 
it co-signed by over 15,000 veterans and military family members as part 
of their "public comment" period.

But now we want to organize more Alaska veterans around this issue, stop 
the development of the mine, and save these jobs. Will you contribute $5 
or more to domain.com to help us take this fight to the next level? You 
can contribute here.

Bristol Bay is one of those places where you can still find true solitude 
while catching trophy rainbow trout and hunting moose and game birds.

It's a place where many veterans travel as tourists, earn a living as 
fishing guides, professional fisherman, or work on the shore supporting 
the fishing industry.

Thanks for joining me in defense of their jobs.
