John: Reading Tom's email, I can tell he's serious about how close this 
race could be for John Douglass. But I'd like to let you in on a secret -- 
John's polling shows his opponent under 50%. This election is ours to win. 
We're just $4,285 to goal - give generously right away.

-- Delegate David Toscano
