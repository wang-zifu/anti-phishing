Treasure trove of potential publicity for "The Monuments Men".   New York Times cover story today.  "In a Rediscovered Trove of Art, a Triumph Over the Nazis' Will"

Cover story by art critic Michael Kimmerman.

Also...

Inside story on C1.."German Officials Provide Details on Looted Art". By Melissa Eddy, Alison Smale, Patricia Cohen and Randy Kennedy

Story is off the wall amazing and a treasure trove for advance publicity for "The Monuments Men"...

There is the mention in this article...

Jonathan Petropoulos, a professor of history at Claremont McKenna College in California and the author of "The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany," called the trove the most important discovery of Nazi looted art since the Allies discovered the horded in the salt mines and the castles."

Doesn't get any closer to home.

What's our game plan?

The first thing George said to me when I walked onto his set at the Duckford Airbase in England during filming in May was..."Find me stolen art"!!!!

Well....here it is.  Let's figure out how to bring attention to the film.....and collect all the names of American and European people involved in the hunt, discovery and media coverage and get them to see the film.   They will write about in endlessly.
