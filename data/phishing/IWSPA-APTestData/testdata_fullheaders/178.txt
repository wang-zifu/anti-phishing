Just got a note he cancelled his trip last min. So taking that off the calen
dar. As I said yesterday, you have that 4-6:30 pm block today that we can fi
t try any calls or meetings that have been itching you. But there are many, a
nd I don't want to presume, so will domain.com your guidance on what you want to d
o with the time. Other than Ali Zaidi. If you haven't talked with him, I'll s
ee if he's free then.
