Changes to eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy

Dear jnazario,

I'm writing to let you know that the eBay User Agreement and eBay Privacy P
olicy have been updated, effective immediately for users registering as of 
Nov. 22, 2005, and effective February 1, 2015 for current users.

eBay User Agreement =3D=3D> <>
eBay Privacy Policy =3D=3D> <>

The rules and dispute resolution policies you originally agreed to have not
 changed in any substantive way. The User Agreement has been rewritten, how
ever, to cover new features such as Reviews & Guides, changes in the collec
tion of overdue seller fees, and to better meet the needs of our growing us
er community.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines the broad categories of 
information we collect from you based on your activities on the site and pu
blic data sources. It also now specifically calls out the fact that eBay do
es not sell your personal information for marketing purposes and directs yo
u to a page where you can select how you wish to be contacted by eBay. If y
ou would like to receive advance notice of pricing promotions, events, and 
other updates, be sure to select "Newsletters, promotions, and event notifi
cations" in your Notification Preferences.

If you accept the new User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you don't need to 
take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new User Agreement or Pri
vacy Policy, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions about the User 
Agreement Revision for instructions on what to do.

Thank you for using eBay and we look forward to many more successful transa
ctions!

Sincerely, 

Scott R. Shipman, CIPP 
Senior Counsel, Global Privacy Practices
eBay Inc.
