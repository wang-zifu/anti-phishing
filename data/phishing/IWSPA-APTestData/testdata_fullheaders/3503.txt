SSN ORIGINALS




SSN Screening Series: Shameless’ Emmy Rossum and William H. Macy Talk Writer’s Room, Mini Golf & Meeting the Other Frank

SSN’s Emmy screening of Showtime’s Shameless packed the Landmark Wednesday night. The series is entering the Emmy race for the first time as a comedy and its stars were there for a lively, hilarious Q&A after the screening, which we bring you here. (SSN)



Marvel 101: Your Handy Guide to X-Men: Days of Future Past

Fox releases the film May 23, the seventh in the X-Men franchise that’s grossed $2.3B to date. There’s a lot to keep track of in this new film, which combines both old and new X-Men. SSN has whipped up a character cheat- sheet so that you can sit back and simply enjoy the show. (SSN)



Louis C.K. Gets More Emmy Nominations than Anyone Even Though He Couldn’t Care Less

He’s a comedy genius operating at the top of his game, wearing the mantle of fame with a certain rumpled savoir-faire. SSN looks at the C.K. phenomenon and the most remarkable fact being that he’s alone as an entertainer doing things entirely on his own terms. (SSN)



Spotlight: How Showrunner Scott Rosenbaum Shakes Up the Police Procedural with ‘Gang Related’

Scott Rosenbaum (Chuck, V, The Shield) returns to his L.A. cop procedural roots as his new crime drama Gang Related, created by Fast & Furious franchise writer Chris Morgan, debuts Thursday. He spoke to SSN about its diverse cast, inevitable comparisons to The Shield, and the passion project that’s waiting in the wings. (SSN)



Why Did Pacific Rim Fail to Connect with US Audiences While Godzilla Hit Home?

Why did Pacific Rim, a gonzo pop art masterwork with the inside of  Guillermo del Toro’s brain spilling all over a $200 million canvas fail to connect  with U.S. audiences especially, while Godzilla did? We have some ideas here. (SSN)
