Punt to NV state party

And then give them this quote:

"We're confident that Democrats will be united and energized at our convention and throughout the general election. In primary contests across the country, a vast majority of Democratic voters have made it clear that they believe our primary process has unified the party, and most are excited about both of our candidates. At the same time, our candidates have each said they will work hard to make sure that Donald Trump and his dangerous and divisive policies never set foot in the Oval Office. We know what's at stake, and that the American people can't afford a Republican like Trump in office who would drag our country backwards."
