Dear John,



We were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting in Arizona. Our hearts broke for those who lost their lives in Arizona, and the families they left behind. It was also not lost on us that Congresswoman Giffords has been a true friend to veterans, and has always been there for us.



Gabrielle Giffords has done much for veterans during her short time in Congress. From proposing and passing a standard $1000 tax deduction for troops called to war, and allowing them to qualify for an Earned Income Tax domain.com and Child Care tax domain.com, to backing advance funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and supporting the Women Veterans Health Care Improvement Act, Representative Giffords has made the most of her time on the Committee on Armed Services. As the only Member of Congress with an Active Duty Military spouse, Congresswoman Giffords knew very well the issues that our troops and veterans face.



Thankfully, Dr. Peter Rhee, a former Navy surgeon, has helped the Congresswoman pull through the initial phases of recovery. Now, we would like you to join us in wishing Congresswoman Giffords well.

By clicking the link above, you'll join with us in a message that will be delivered to Representative Giffords' office, to show her support. While we can't do much to help her recover other than pray, we feel it's important to show whatever support we can, because she's always been there to support us.



Please join us in wishing her well.



Sincerely,



Ashwin Madia
Iraq War Veteran
