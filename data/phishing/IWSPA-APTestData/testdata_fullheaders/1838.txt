Hillary Clinton gained an apparent ally Thursday in her fight to domain.com the
political damage from her growing email controversy, as former Republican
secretary of state Colin L. Powell said he disagreed with a State
Department decision to retroactively classify two emails from his personal
account while in office.

=E2=80=9CI have reviewed the messages, and I do not see what makes them
classified,=E2=80=9D Powell said of the emails, which were uncovered late l
ast year
by the State Department=E2=80=99s inspector general and, he said, brought t
o his
attention by the department in recent weeks.

The emails, initially sent to the State Department by two U.S. ambassadors
serving abroad and forwarded to Powell=E2=80=99s account by an aide, were d
escribed
in notifications sent to Congress in recent days by the State Department
and intelligence community inspectors general.

Those notifications also said that 10 emails with retroactively classified
information had been found on private accounts of the =E2=80=9Cimmediate st
aff=E2=80=9D of
Condoleezza Rice, Powell=E2=80=99s immediate successor in the second term o
f the
George W. Bush administration.

The originators of the messages to Powell did not classify them, he said,
and =E2=80=9Cif the department wishes to say a dozen years later they shoul
d have
been classified, that is an opinion of the department that I do not share.
=E2=80=9D

Powell has said in the past that he found the State Department computer
system, including domain.com and email, to be woefully inadequate when he
took office there in 2001. He devoted substantial re=C2=ADsources to improv
ing
it but also made liberal use of his personal AOL account.

His entry into the controversy capped a week of revelations and allegations
coinciding with the nation=E2=80=99s hotly contested first presidential pri
mary
contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. It began with the State Department=E2
=80=99s
acknowledgment last week that it agreed with an intelligence assessment
that =E2=80=9Ctop secret=E2=80=9D information was included in 22 of the ten
s of thousands
of emails that passed through the private server Clinton used while in
office.

Clinton has said that the emails in question did not originate with her,
and that the information was not =E2=80=9Cmarked classified=E2=80=9D when s
he received it.
Late Thursday, after Powell=E2=80=99s remarks, her campaign released a stat
ement
saying she =E2=80=9Cagrees with her predecessor that his emails, like hers,
 are
being inappropriately subjected to over-classification.=E2=80=9D

The existence of Clinton=E2=80=99s private email server was uncovered as pa
rt of a
Republican-led congressional investigation of her actions before and after
the 2015 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that left two State Department
officials and two CIA contractors dead.

The =E2=80=9Ctop secret=E2=80=9D 22 are part of 1,600 Clinton emails the St
ate Department
has retroactively classified all or in part, according to a senior
congressional aide with access to the material, with the vast majority in
the lowest-level category of =E2=80=9Cconfidential.=E2=80=9D

One or more refer to North Korea, the aide said, including =E2=80=9Csome de
ployment
of assets,=E2=80=9D an apparent reference to intelligence-collection capabi
lities.
But the emails include no attached classified documents or material that
could definitively be said to come from classified analysis. =E2=80=9CI wou
ldn=E2=80=99t
characterize it as typing off the high side,=E2=80=9D the aide said, referr
ing to
clearly sensitive material. The messages contain =E2=80=9Cfar more operatio
nal
discussion than regurgitation of [intelligence] analytical product.=E2=80
=9D

Other published accounts have said the classified emails include internal
commentary on a New York Times story about drone attacks.

Catch up on the controversy and read the e-mailsVIEW GRAPHIC

The State Department and the intelligence community have clashed over the
origin of some of the material, with intelligence agencies saying
information could only be gleaned from classified sources and State saying
much of it comes from its own personnel simply paying attention to the
obvious in the countries in question.

After the =E2=80=9Ctop secret=E2=80=9D revelations, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-
Utah), chairman
of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, indicated to the
State Department that he was considering opening an investigation into the
extent to which Clinton may have compromised national security.

The House Republican leadership was already considering how to respond to
the Clinton email issue, according to a congressional source familiar with
the sequence of events. That discussion was pushed toward resolution when
Chaffetz, in a Politico interview published Wednesday, said he was
preparing to open a new probe of Clinton.

On Wednesday evening, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin
McCarthy (R-Calif.) called Chaffetz to a meeting to temper his zeal. He was
told that the leaders had made a =E2=80=9Ccollective decision=E2=80=9D that
 anything
related to Clinton and her emails =E2=80=9Cwas best left to the FBI,=E2=80
=9D said the
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate the closed-door
discussions. The only exception was the ongoing Benghazi investigation.

The FBI has been conducting an investigation of whether the use of
non=C2=ADgovernment servers violated federal records laws and classificatio
n
regulations.

Some lawmakers with access to the 22 emails have offered public
assessments, generally along partisan lines, of their potential to cause
security damage.

=E2=80=9CThey do reveal classified methods. They do reveal classified sourc
es, and
they do reveal human assets,=E2=80=9D Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a member
 of the
House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News on Wednesday. =E2=80=9CI can=E2
=80=99t imagine
how anyone could be familiar with these emails, whether they=E2=80=99re sen
ding
them or receiving them, and not realize that these are highly classified.
=E2=80=9D

Committee member Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Thursday that he would not
comment on the content, =E2=80=9Cand I urge others to let the process proce
ed
unimpeded by politics."

But, Schiff said, =E2=80=9Cit is more than a little ironic that people are 
leaking
classified information about this while excoriating Secretary Clinton for
her handling of classified information. In light of reports that have
surfaced indicating that Republican secretaries of state and their
immediate staffs had classified information on their personal accounts, the
GOP focus on Secretary Clinton is all the more transparently political.=E2
=80=9D

Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) took to the Senate floor late
Thursday to agree. By GOP logic, he said, =E2=80=9Cwe would have to crimina
lly
charge Secretary Rice, Secretary Powell, the senior staff and everyone else
who received these emails. We might have to indict the entire senior level
of America=E2=80=99s national security team. . . . This is absurd.=E2=80=9D

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight
Committee, first revealed the inspector general notifications Thursday. He
said in a statement that he had been informed of the Powell and Rice emails
through a memo marked =E2=80=9CNot for Distribution=E2=80=9D that was sent 
by the
department=E2=80=99s inspector general to Undersecretary for Management Pat
rick
Kennedy on Wednesday.

The same information, he said, had already been provided to =E2=80=9Cother
congressional staff without authorization=E2=80=9D by the intelligence insp
ector
general.

In a letter requesting further information from Secretary of State John F.
Kerry, Cummings said the memo indicated that a records review was being
conducted of five previous secretaries of state and their immediate staffs.
Out of =E2=80=9Cpotentially sensitive records=E2=80=9D referred by the insp
ector general to
the department for further review, he said, the inspector general reported
that 12, dating between February 2015 and June 2008, were determined to
contain =E2=80=9Cclassified national security information.=E2=80=9D Two had
 been sent to
Powell=E2=80=99s personal account and 10 sent to accounts of Rice=E2=80=99s
 staff.

=E2=80=9CAccording to the memo,=E2=80=9D Cummings wrote, =E2=80=9Cnone of t
he emails was marked as
classified.=E2=80=9D
