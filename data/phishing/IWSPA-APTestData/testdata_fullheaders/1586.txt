We are touring on Wed. My son is very excited and he is a talented editor. A little spotty on the academics, but pulled it together this year. He is going into his senior year at Beverly Hills High School. If I need you to pull a string (and I might) i will reach out! Thanks Steve. I think it is a great fit for him.
