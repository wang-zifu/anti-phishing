Hey John -- just wrapped up a two week domain.com to the States for the annual
US/India dialogue, and POTUS/PM had a good meeting at UNGA as well.  India
released their INDC yesterday for Paris....no major surprises.  All else is
going well here, and trying to maintain the momentum in so many areas.  We
remain in a strong place on the bilateral relationship.  Been following all
your progress...keep up the good fight.

Rich
