I met with Anne Summers, Larry Marx (ED of the Donor Collaborative of Wis
consin), Mike Tate (ED of Advancing Wisconsin) in Milwaukee to discuss th
eir progress toward raising the $1M in-state by July 31 for Advancing Wis
consin that the Fund agreed to match at our last board meeting.

Advancing Wisconsin's board is Bob Gibson (SEIU), Sara Rogers (AFL), Bob 
Burke (WEAC) and Kim Warkentin (AV).
They have firm commitments of $641,000 so far from the Donor Collaborativ
e of Wisconsin with a good possibility of an additional $150,000-$250,000
=20in-state gift in the next couple of weeks.

I am going to make donor visits and do call time next week in Madison and
=20Milwaukee. Governor Doyle's former Department of Administration Secret
ary Marc Marotta has agreed to assist us with the in-state fundraising to
=20get to the $1M match.

I have a call Monday morning with Andrea Soros and Michael Vachon to disc
uss a possible gift to Advancing Wisconsin which will get credited to the
=20Fund's $1M commitment. 

Advancing Wisconsin has begun hiring canvassers and is coordinating turf 
with the Working America and Citizen Action's canvasses.

We have grossed over $30,000 for the Citizen Action 25th Anniversary roas
t and toast event  on June 14 which will go to support their canvass prog
ram. Thanks Mary Pat for your contribution to this effort.

The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO has raised over $250,000 from AFL and CTW uni
ons in-state for the Working America canvass in Milwaukee. They are still
=20looking to reach their budget of $500,000.

Citizen Action's canvass is focusing in the Green Bay area.

Local health care advisory initiative petitions are being circulated to g
et on the ballot in numerous municipalities  for issue advocacy in the fa
ll.

A detailed memo has been written about why Wisconsin in combination with 
Ohio is essential to winning the White House given its past performance i
n 2015 and 2004. Numerous Electoral College scenarios are simulated in th
e memo and the conclusion is abundantly clear that Ohio and Wisconsin are
=20must win states for either party unless you are a believer in Florida 
or Virginia, Colorado and North Carolina really come into play for the De
mocrats. Our work to elevate issues and educate the public about the cand
idates' records will be well worth our investment in the state.

Hope this helps.Let me know if you have any questions.
