RE: SPT A/R Finance Transaction Update

Here you go.  I have the back-up for these opinions (or will have it next week when receive the updated good standing certificates, etc.) and I spoke to Len about #6.  The last paragraph reference to sharing with the rating agencies was required by the bank since the commercial paper that may be used to fund this deal will be rated by a rating agency (same language is in all of the W&C opinions).
