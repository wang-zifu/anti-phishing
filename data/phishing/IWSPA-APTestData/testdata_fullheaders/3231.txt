Amy and Hannah,

Thanks to you both, Nancy Tate got to awaken today with hope in her heart and tears in her eyes.

I've been on email with her since early this morning.

Had it not been for your efforts yesterday with our beloved Laura Ziskin's cancer group, there would have

been no hope for Alexis, Nancy's wife. 

Along with Stand Up To Cancer it turns out that my new neighbor in Venice

has the top organization in town for cancer support. Nancy and Alexis were struggling to get in and now it,

too, is a done deal.

The blessings abound right now.

On the: Iszy is BEYOND AMAZING front! She is growing professionally at the speed of light! My work with Audax has been extended for another 9 months. It's a pleasure and a privilege to be on her winning team. 

My prediction: Iszy is going to emerge as one of the great exec's in this town, following in your footsteps and making you both VERY PROUD.

I love you both very much.

XO deb
