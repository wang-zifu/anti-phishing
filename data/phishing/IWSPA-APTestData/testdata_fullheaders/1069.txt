I added the tags: "DNC" "User" "RNC" and "Sean Spicer" and made the video public, which should help it be seen more than unlisted. Let me know if you'd like anything else changed.

Thank you sir! Pls upload to YouTube DNCclips Unlisted

Title: DNC's User Debates RNC's Sean Spicer on New Day

Questions: Forgive my ignorance but How can we optimize visibility to this? Can we add tags or maybe a transcript to the description?
