 Boehner -- #JustVote

the current shutdown and debt ceiling standoff, as if there are two intract
able sides that are equally culpable for =93grid lock=94.

American people, and the majority of both houses of Congress oppose the Tea
 Party=92s shutdown of the government =96 and threatened refusal to pay Ame
rica=92s bills. 

to go back to work and believe that America should honor its debts.  They d
on=92t believe these tactics should be used for any reason =96 certainly no
t as a means to prevent implementation of the health care law.  Just yester
day a new poll by Public Policy Polling (PPP) =96 one of the most accurate 
polling firms in the last election cycle =96 found that overwhelming majori
ties opposed the shutdown in 24 swing Congressional Districts currently hel
d by Republicans.

ng control of these districts =96 and the House as a whole =96 because of t
heir shutdown.

iew with George Stephanopoulos, there is clearly a majority of Members in t
he House to pass a =93clean=94 continuing resolution that would put the fed
eral government back to work =96 and instruct the Treasury to pay America
=92s bills.  One hundred and ninety five Democrats have signed a letter ind
icating they would support such a measure =96 in fact it would probably rec
eive 200 Democratic votes.  And at least twenty-two Republicans have public
ly stated they would do so as well.  That adds up to an unbeatable 217 Hous
e votes (there are currently three vacancies making 217 the magic number fo
r a majority).  Assuming, of course, the Republicans still believe in the s
cience of mathematics.

=96 call a vote.

The bill would pass, the hostage taking by his Tea Party faction would be o
ver, and the Tea Party extremists would hold him responsible.

 that is keeping the government closed.  It is also the only thing that thr
eatens the first default by the U.S. government in American history =96 an 
act that could have a catastrophic effect on the financial system and the w
orld economy.

about being terrorized by a Tea Party minority or having a legacy as the on
e man who single handedly caused a world wide economic disaster.  If he car
es about this country, his choice should be obvious.

ll almost certainly lose their seats in Congress if Boehner continues on hi
s current path.  If the Republican leadership wants to create the wave that
 could overcome all of their attempts to redistrict themselves into a perma
nent majority, this is the sure way to do it.

 lock=94 but John Boehner. 

=92s broken immigration system and provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 
million aspiring Americans.   So far Boehner has been unwilling to cross an
 even smaller faction of anti-immigrant zealots like Congressman Steve King
 and simply call a vote.

l which is not only supported by a majority in the House but by 90% of the 
American people. 

in America=92s infrastructure to create jobs, and expand educational opport
unity. 

es unwilling to give an inch. A small extremist faction of one party, in on
e House of Congress, in one branch of government, is holding America hostag
e.  House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Whip Kevin
 McCarthy are simply too terrorized by that small Tea Party faction to allo
w votes on proposals that have the support of the vast majority of American
s =96 and a majority of Members of the House.

ady everyday people are suffering.  Like the children who are not allowed t
o begin clinical trials to see if promising new therapies can stop their ca
ncer =96 or the people whose vacations have been canceled by the closure of
 our national parks =96 or the hundreds of thousands of workers who have be
en laid off by the federal government =96 or the tens of thousands of busin
ess owners who depend on those workers to patronize their cafes and stores.



ld.

in the last election.  They cannot pass what they want through the constitu
tional process in Congress =96 so they have taken the country and its econo
my hostage.

 will back down from their refusal to negotiate with these hostage takers b
ecause if they do, it will never end. Tea Party Republicans will take hosta
ges again every time they have any opportunity.

rt term, than to allow a tiny extremist group to use extra-constitutional m
eans to extort whatever it wants from the majority for years to come. 

 the outcome of the last election.   They talk endlessly about =93constitut
ional government=94 but refuse to abide by the legislative process that the
 constitution provides.

 pretense that each side is somehow equally culpable in this =93standoff=94
 and demand that Boehner allow a vote on the floor for a clean continuing r
esolution and a clean increase in the debt ceiling.

t democracy. #JustVote.
