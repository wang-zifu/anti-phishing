SAG Q&A Tonight

Good evening - Tonight we screened American Hustle for SAG at the Bruin in Westwood to a full theatre and enthusiastic crowd.

It was announced at the start of the screening that Bradley was unable to attend due to the weather and missing his flight and we lost 3 women only. Even after this announcement, there was applause for when it was announced that David, Shea, Elisabeth, and Paul were participating.  

Backstage did a live stream of the Q&A with moderator and Backstage Editor Sean Miller.

The conversation was focused on the preparation for the roles, the auditions and process working with David as well as working together with the other actors. David talked about developing the stories about the characters.

The audience asked questions ranging from the music choices, the editing process between David and his team, voice over selections and the real life people vs the fictional

characters.  It was an engaged and balanced conversation, and all panelists were able to contribute.

Good night.
