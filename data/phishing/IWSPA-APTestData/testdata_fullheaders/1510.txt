John --

The Obamacare marketplace opens tomorrow, November 1st --
and we need your help.

More than 15 million Americans have found quality,
affordable health insurance since the marketplace opened two
years ago. That's pretty exciting news, but millions more
are still uninsured.

For the next three months, we're going to be working hard to
make sure that every American who needs coverage has the
information they need to get it. Chip in today, and help
support that work:

Thank you,

Jack

people covered, improving real lives. This work matters --
