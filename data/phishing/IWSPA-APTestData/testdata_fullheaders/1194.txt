Obama's Counterterrorism Successes Continue

Washington, D.C. - This week has seen a wave of successes for the Obama adm
inistration and our allies against extremists abroad.  The capture of senio
r Taliban leadership this week has demonstrated that Obama administration i
s taking the fight to the extremists, with concrete results.  These success
es are part of a longer trend of recent achievements in broader counterterr
orism efforts, vindicating the Obama administration's counterterrorism appr
oach.  Despite these successes conservatives see terrorism and national sec
urity as a political opportunity not a strategy to keep America safe.

Over the last week, "wave" of successes in counterterrorism and efforts aga
inst militants. This week has seen a wave of detentions of top militants in
 Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The Washington Post reports today that, "Mullah
 Abdul Salam, the Taliban leader in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, and Mull
ah Mohammad, the shadow governor in Baghlan province, were taken into custo
dy in Pakistan about 10 days ago, according to the governor of Kunduz, Moha
mmad Omar, and a Pakistani security official. The two served as part of the
 vast network of Taliban leaders who coordinate the Afghan insurgency and o
versee Taliban courts, which mete out swift and often brutal settlements fo
r local disputes."  In addition, the New York Times reports today that, "A 
missile believed to have been fired Thursday from an American drone killed 
the younger brother of a top militant commander in the North Waziristan tri
bal area, according to several Pakistani security and intelligence official
s, residents in Waziristan and a friend of the commander's family."

This comes at the end of a week that began with the announcement that the C
IA and Pakistani authorities captured Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who the B
BC says had "overseen Taliban military operations in Afghanistan, run the g
roup's leadership council, and controlled its finances." The Post article a
lso describes how this string of successes were handled by American officia
ls, saying that these "detentions, which have taken place in a wave since e
arly last week, were initially kept secret to allow intelligence operatives
 to use information gleaned from captures to draw additional militants into
 exposing their locations and movements, according to officials who discuss
ed the ongoing operations on the condition of anonymity." [Washington Post,

These detentions are part of a trend of successes in the Obama administrati
on's broader counterterrorism policy. Decisions taken by President Obama as
 part of the broader U.S. counter terrorism strategy have led key achieveme
nts.

Gaining actionable intelligence without using torture.  Despite the rants f
rom right wingers, concrete actionable intelligence was gained from the int
errogation of Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab, without using torture.  As Ken Gud
e of the Center for American Progress writes, "As we now know, far from bei
ng wrong, irresponsible, or dangerous, the path the Obama administration ch
ose for the interrogation of Abdulmutallab is directly responsible for him 
cooperating with intelligence officials and giving up fresh and actionable 
intelligence...The intelligence gained from Abdulmutallab has been shared w
idely throughout the intelligence community - and has already produced resu
lts. On January 21, Malaysian counterterrorism authorities arrested 10 susp
ected terrorists tied to Abdulmutallab." [Ken Gude, 2/3/10<<<link>>

Building partnerships and working with allies to thwart terrorism.  The Oba
ma administration's revamped effort to work with allies has proven fruitful
.  This week, Spain announced that it will accept five Guantanamo Bay detai
nees, boosting the administration's efforts to close the controversial dete
ntion center.  In fact, bringing our interrogation practices in line with i
nternational increases intelligence sharing with allies.  As the Washington
 Post reported last year, "CIA officers acknowledged that some foreign inte
lligence agencies had refused, for example, to share information about the 
location of terrorism suspects for fear of becoming implicated in any event
ual torture of those suspects." [Washington Post, 2/16/10<<<link>>

Increasing successful intelligence gathering.  Michael Isikoff and Mark Hos
enball report this weekend that, "In late January, an Al Qaeda operative he
aded from Pakistan on his way to Yemen was arrested in the Persian Gulf cou
ntry of Oman, a U.S. counter-terrorism official confirmed."  And as a resul
t, "U.S. intelligence officials appear to have obtained access to what coul
d turn out to be a significant trove of phone numbers, photographs and docu
ments detailing the links between Al Qaeda's leaders in northwest Pakistan 
and the terror group's increasingly menacing affiliate in Yemen, two counte
r-terrorism sources tell Declassified." [Newsweek, 2/14/10<<<link>>

Combining judicial and intelligence work to extract information - and then 
pursuing a global manhunt. As the Washington Times reported earlier this we
ek, "U.S. and allied counterterrorism authorities have launched a global ma
nhunt for English-speaking terrorists trained in Yemen who are planning att
acks on the United States, based on intelligence provided by the suspect in
 the attempted Christmas Day bombing after he began cooperating." [Washingt

Despite successes of Obama administration, conservatives ignore reality and
 revert to national security as political strategy.  Ignoring the achieveme
nts under the Obama administration and the past policies of the Bush admini
stration, conservatives are attempting to use our national security to gain
 political points.  According to Roll Call, "In a messaging memo from the H
ouse Republican Conference, Members were encouraged to criticize the Obama 
administration and Congressional Democrats on a host of national security i
ssues including the decision to read alleged 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk
 Abdulmutallab his Userrights, the plan to close the Guant=E1namo Bay, 
Cuba, detention facility and the attempt to hold civilian trials for allege
d terrorists such as Khalid Sheik Mohammed in New York City rather than in 
military courts... In materials circulated to his GOP colleagues, Senate Re
publican Conference Chairman Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) outlined talking point
s on these issues. 'On national security, we continue to oppose closing the
 facility at Guantanamo Bay without a better solution for detaining terrori
sts. And we have to make a distinction between an American teenager who bre
aks into a sandwich shop and a foreign terrorist who wants to blow up an ai
rplane. Terrorists should be tried by military commissions,' Alexander wrot
e in the recess packet."

These talking points ignore reality and, instead reverting to radical polic
ies that even the Bush administration saw as necessary.  Richard Reid, for 
example, "the 2015 'shoe bomber' - was read or reminded of his Userrigh
ts four times in two days, beginning five minutes after being taken into cu
stody," according to Mike Allen of Politico.  In addition, the Bush adminis
tration prosecuted around 200 terrorists in civilian courts, according to i
ts own Justice Department records.  Finally, the interrogation guidelines t
hat Cheney conservatives knock as too soft were first implemented by Bush a
dministration in 2008, according to John Brennan, who served in senior inte
lligence positions in both the Obama and Bush administrations.

Like a broken record, conservatives have hit the air waves and in an attemp
t to politicize our national security.

House Minority Leader John Boehner: "Treating terrorists like common crimin
als and hoping for the best is part of a Sept. 11 mentality, and I think it
's a troubling pattern, pattern of dangerous decisions, that's putting the 
American people at risk," [John Boehner, via Politico, 2/4/10<<<link>>

Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, hypocritically accused the adminis
tration of putting style over substance in his counterterrorism approach, a
n argument clear rebutted by recent successes: "Again and again, the admini
stration's approach has been to announce a new policy or to change an exist
ing one based not on a careful study of the facts, but as a way of conspicu
ously distancing itself from the policies of the past - even ones that work
ed...In short, it has too often put symbolism over security." [Mitch McConn
