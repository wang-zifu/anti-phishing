TONIGHT:  Punch TV Network Q&A

Hey, Happy Monday!  So often I receive emails from writers seeking agents, or producers looking to meet TV/film executives for the purpose of getting their script, short film, web series or feature film sold.  Tonight is a GREAT opportunity for writers, producers and even savvy actors to learn about Punch TV Network's programming slate and needs.  Join us this evening (Mon, Feb. 10) from 7-9PM for a "Q&A with Television Executive" in Los Angeles.  Bring your  project one-sheets, sizzles, screeners, etc. The Director of Programming for Punch TV Network will join us for an intimate Q&A discussion on television programming. To RSVP, click here or see below for more details. Investing in your career is a crucial aspect of breaking into Hollywood. The event is $45 for Non-BiH Members; BiH Members get to attend for FREE - so no excuses!  The opportunities that we often seek as artists are not always found at the obvious events nor the obvious speakers.  Hope to see you there!
