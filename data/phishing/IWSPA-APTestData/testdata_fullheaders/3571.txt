It was good to see you at LinkedIn.

I know this may be a stretch for Hillary, both in terms of timing, and
possibly priorities, but I thought I'd ask what you think.

I'm working to develop a new event about technology and the future of the
economy, tentatively entitled WTF? (What's the Future? :-) in San Francisco
November 12-13, which I'm co-hosting with Andy McAfee of MIT, co-author of
the book The Second Machine Age. My ideas are also deeply influenced by
Nick Hanauer, who I think CAP may have worked with on some of the concepts
of Middle Out Economics.

Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft), Andy Rubin, Reid Hoffman, Evan Williams
of Twitter and Medium, Travis Kalanick of Uber, Logan Green of Lyft, and
many others have agreed to join the program.  I'm also in conversations
with other business leaders from outside Silicon Valley, including Jeff
Immelt at GE, Tom Pritzker at Hyatt and Howard Schultz at Starbucks (with
whom I worked on a Markle report about the future of the economy, which was
one of the triggers for this event.)

It's shaping up to be a great event.

Seeing some of the back and forth between Hillary and Elizabeth Warren, and
the importance of understanding the future of the economy, especially how
technology is changing the job market, I had this thought that this might
be a really interesting venue for Hillary to make an appearance.  The event
will feature a lot of Silicon Valley heavy hitters (and we might even be
able to organize a fundraiser at the same time), and I think that it's
important that folks out in the Valley hear Hillary's message.  (For what
it's worth, Elizabeth Warren is speaking at the Re/Code event in June,
which will be targeted at somewhat the same audience.)

Let me know if this is worth pursuing.  I'm also wondering if there is
anyone involved with the Middle Out Economics effort at CAP that I ought to
be reaching out to.

Thanks.

For reference, I've included a brief summary outlining some of the themes
and focus of the program below.

*WTF?*

The first industrial revolution led to profound economic disruption,
followed only decades later by a century of enormous progress and
prosperity.  Now, in the second industrial revolution, led by remarkable
new progress in digital technology, we are once again facing an immense
social transformation in the nature of work. New kinds of automation are
removing or redefining white collar jobs, and digital technology, culture,
as business models pervade not only media but every kind of business. At
the same time, innovation will create undreamed of new kinds of jobs, as
technology is harnessed to make humans more productive, and able to tackle
the world=E2=80=99s great challenges.

Technological progress changes the business world, and the world. Steam
power gave us factories, railroads, and industrial capitalism. Electricity
ushered in the assembly line, the elevator, and movie stars. Internal
combustion led to cars, jets, suburbs, and beach vacations.

So far the digital revolution has given us etail, warehouse robots,
artificial intelligence, and the peer economy. And it=E2=80=99s only just g
etting
started.

We all believe that the biggest changes are still ahead, and that every
industry and every organization will have to transform itself in the next
few years, in multiple ways, or fade away. But until now there=E2=80=99s be
en no
event dedicated to these changes -- no focused, high-level conversation
about the deep ways in which computers and their kin are transforming how
we do business, how we work, and how we live. Just about everyone=E2=80=99s
 asking
*WTF?* (=E2=80=9Cwhat=E2=80=99s the future?=E2=80=9D), but answers have bee
n hard to come by.

That=E2=80=99s why we=E2=80=99re launching WTF? as an executive level event
, similar in
style to O=E2=80=99Reilly=E2=80=99s past Web 2.0 domain.com, which provided cla
rity and focus
to the transformation of Silicon Valley after the domain.com bust.  Our goal is
to shed light on the transformation in the nature of work now being driven
by algorithms, big data, robotics, and the emerging peer economy.

WTF is where the geeks meet the suits, and where the incumbents and
upstarts come together to talk about what=E2=80=99s happening, and more imp
ortantly
what=E2=80=99s going to happen. Our speakers include Silicon Valley visiona
ries and
high tech CEOs, and also leaders from the rest of the economy: the
industries that are being transformed by technological progress. We=E2=80
=99ll also
hear from the top academics and other thought leaders who study these
issues. And we=E2=80=99ll highlight sharp new talent -- people you might no
t have
heard of before who are doing amazing things.

Some of the themes we are exploring include:

AI and white collar jobs (The Race Against the Machine)

Advanced manufacturing and re-shoring

Augmented Reality in the Workplace

Networks and the Nature of the Firm (the Uber/AirBnb Economy)

Workers in a world of =E2=80=9Ccontinuous partial employment=E2=80=9D

Security in a connected world

The data-driven business

The attention economy

The event will be held November 12 and 13 at the Palace Hotel in San
Francisco.  Attendance will be by invitation only, and is expected to
consist of approximately 1000 senior executives, VCs, policy-makers, and
entrepreneurs.
