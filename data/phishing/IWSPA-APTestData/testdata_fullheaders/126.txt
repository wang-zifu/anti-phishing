	Amy,

	Do you know an emerging leader who has a vision for change and wants to make Los Angeles a better place? The Jewish Federation’s New Leaders Project has been training the next generation of Jewish civic leaders for 25 years, and is now accepting applications from Jewish young adults between the ages of 27-40 who have demonstrated a commitment to civic and/or Jewish leadership.

	Participants in this premier program will:

		Meet and work with top elected, civic, and community leaders from across the region who are helping transform Los Angeles



		Gain a deep understanding of economic, social, and political challenges facing our city



		Develop instrumental leadership skills and a vibrant network that will help them make a difference in the community

	Applications are being accepted through November 30th—learn more and apply now!

	The Federation operates NLP because we are committed to strengthening Los Angeles and helping to create the next generation of Jewish leaders. Participants will join hundreds of NLP alumni who are transforming Los Angeles as elected officials, city and county commissioners, community leaders, non-domain.com directors and business executives.

	NLP is an exclusive program and space is limited.




	Please share this e-mail with young leaders you know who are passionate about building a stronger city.

	Best,

	Jesse Gabriel
	Chair, New Leaders Project

	The Jewish Federation’s Community Engagement Strategic Initiative mobilizes the Los Angeles Jewish community to pursue an inclusive society that reflects the best of American and Jewish values, a strong Jewish future, and a safe and vibrant Israel. We do this by working to build a community with meaningful relationships and a better city and state.
