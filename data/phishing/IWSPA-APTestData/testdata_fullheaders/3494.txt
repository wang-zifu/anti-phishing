*On Muslim =93Radicalization=94 Hearings, National Security Experts Agree:
The Biggest Thing To Fear=85 Is The Fear-Mongering*

*On Thursday, March 10th, Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee Peter
King (R-NY) is holding a hearing on =93The Extent of Radicalization in the
American Muslim Community and that Community's Response.=94 HOWEVER=85*

* *

=B7         *What national security experts actually fear is fear itself=97
and
fear-mongering. * =93The most likely outcome of this hearing is that it wil
l
be a pointless political show. The worst-case scenario is that the hearing
will actually play into the hands of al Qaeda
recruiters<<<link>>

=94 like top recruiter Anwar al Awalaki, who=92s issued ominous
warnings<<<link>>>that =93The West will
eventually turn against its Muslim citizens!=94 writes
counterterrorism expert Brian Fishman. Juan Zarate, White House
counterterrorism adviser under George W. Bush, citing concerns from nationa
l
security experts on =93all sides,=94 said the hearings could do
damage<<<link>>>if they create a sense that
there is a divide between Muslim organizations
and mainstream America. [Brian Fishman, LA Times,

=B7         *Law enforcement officials dispute King=92s claims of
non-cooperation. *LA County Sheriff Lee Baca has said, =93If [Peter King] h
as
evidence of non-cooperation, he should bring it forward... We have as much
cooperation as we are capable of
<<<link>>>acquiring through public trust
relationships.=94 [Lee Baca, via Politico,
2/7/10<<<link>>

]

=B7         *There=92s no empirical evidence of radicalization in American
mosques. *Investigators for a Muslim American Public Opinion Survey
concluded: =93To date, there has been no
data<<<link>>>to
demonstrate that mosques or devout Muslims are at risk of fostering
radicalization.=94 Instead, King=92s claim that =9380 percent=94 of America
n mosques
are radicalized is based on =93a single, unsubstantiated
claim<<<link>>>made by a
California Muslim cleric in 1999,=94 according to a thorough
examination by Media Matters. And this week, King newly suggested that *=93
*only
a =91very small minority=92<<<link>>
/03/kings_witnesses_show_he_cant_s.html>of
Muslims actually pose a danger to the U.S. [=85] exactly the opposite of

=B7         *In fact, mosques - like churches and synagogues - draw
communities together and help deter alienation and radicalization. *A 2015 
Duke-UNC homeland security study found that mosques actually serve as a
deterrent to terrorism <<<link>>>. The Muslim
American Public Opinion Survey also concluded that, *=93*involvement with t
he
mosque, and increased religiosity increases civic engagement and support fo
r
American democratic
values<<<link>>>,
[=85] a finding in social science that is consistent with decades of resear
ch
on other religious groups such as Jews, Protestants.=94 [David Schanzer *et

=B7         *King=92s approach is not only ineffective, but counterproducti
ve to
American security. *As the Chairmen of 9/11 Commission have suggested,
profiling one group =96as these hearings do- overloads the intelligence and
law enforcement agencies with flimsy
leads<<<link>>>and undersupplies
them with crucial information <<<link>>> from
community tips. [Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman, 9/11 Commissioners,

=B7         *Effective community policing requires a two-way
conversation<<<link>>>that extends beyond
conversations with and about cooperation with law
enforcement, *writes counter-terrorism expert David Schanzer.  Americans
worry about being able to pay their taxes, educate their kids and keep thei
r
families safe and healthy; Americans who practice Islam are no different.

=B7         *Fear not: Bipartisan leaders, including Presidents Barack Obam

and George W. Bush, remind us that America=92s diversity is its
strength. *General
Colin Powell asked <<<link>>> in 2008: "Is there
something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that'
s
not America.=94 George W. Bush
said<<<link>>>in
the days following Sept. 11
th, 2001, =93The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not
what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.=94 He concluded that Muslims
practicing their faith =93must be not intimidated in America. That's not th
e
America I know.=94 Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael
Chertoff adds<<<link>>
-homegrown-terror-threat/2/full/>that
American values like =93social integration and religious tolerance=94 are

=B7         *Divided we fall=85 Military and bipartisan security experts ag
ree:
This type of anti-Muslim fear-mongering is not only counter to our values
but also our national security interests:

General David Petraeus**,* U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, said that
incidents like the proposed Koran burning in 2015 could "endanger troops an
d
it could endanger the overall
effort<<<link>>
igious-Freedom-Key-to-National-Security.pdf>here=85.
[I]n fact, images from such activity could very well be used by
extremists here and around the world." [David Petraeus via Human Rights
First, 3/4/11<<<link>>
ing-Religious-Freedom-Key-to-National-Security.pdf>
]

*Major General Paul Eaton*, US Army (Ret) and National Security Network
senior advisor, explains how anti-Islamic rhetoric is harmful to the
military's objectives: "This is unhelpful to the American fighting men and
women and counter to the image we wish to portray in Afghanistan and Iraq."
He added, "It is a slap in the
face<<<link>>>to a great many people
we wish to have as allies.=94 [Paul Eaton, via Media
Matters, 8/16/10 <<<link>>>]

*FBI interrogator Ali Soufan*, an American Muslim himself, warns that this
sort of anti-Muslim rhetoric plays directly into the hands of our
enemies<<<link>>>.
Soufan, who successfully interrogated Abu Zubaydah and discovered that
Khalid Sheikh Mohammad was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, writes: =93W
hen
demagogues appear to be equating Islam with terrorism, it's making young
Muslims unsure about their place in the country. It bolsters the message
that radicalizers are selling: That the war is against Islam, and Muslims
are not welcome in America." [Ali Soufan,
8/18/10<<<link>>
nions-contributors-ali-soufan.html>
]**

=B7         *CONCLUSION: Counterterror experts, intelligence officials and 
law
enforcement agree: find terrorists based on behavior and engagement, not
profiling and isolation. There are real threats, and the American system is
handling them <<<link>>>. To improve security, we
need to focus on actions and oversight and not abandon the values of
tolerance and inclusion on which this country was formed. *[NSN,
