Subject: Special Update: a toxic week for climate denial

Dear John,

This headline in the Washington Post says it all "Why isn't climate deniali
sm politically toxic?"
<<link>>

As the story highlights, this is precisely what your investment in LCV is h
elping to change. For too long, too many politicians have been able to espo
use an extreme, anti-science view on climate change, stalling meaningful pr
ogress on this issue with little consequences.

With your support, LCV has launched an ambitious new campaign to change tha
t.

*  We began by releasing a bipartisan poll showing that young voters overwh
elmingly view climate deniers as "crazy" and "ignorant", and that by overwh
elming margins they support federal action on climate change: <<link>>
.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DWYgFx0iLImvM_666Bkzy8g .

*  Last week, we followed up with hard-hitting ads targeting four climate c
hange deniers in Congress, likely the first ever to focus exclusively on th
eir denial of climate science.

*  On August 13, we partnered with Organizing for Action and some of our st
ate leagues on a high-profile National Day of Action, involving hundreds of
 LCV members across the country at grassroots events outside the offices of
 climate change denying Members of Congress.

This campaign has already reached tens of millions through broad media cove
rage, and it is clear that we have struck a nerve with the deniers.

Of course, this is just the start. We know that oil barons -- like David an
d Charles Koch -- are spending millions of dollars to both undermine the sc
ientific consensus and to prop up climate deniers. So, this needs to be a l
ong-term effort, but it's one that we must win if we are ever going to get 
serious about solving the looming climate crisis.

I hope you'll read more highlights from this work below. Thanks again for a
ll you do.

Onward,

Gene

Holding Climate Deniers Accountable

LCV launched a potent, nearly $2 million campaign to inform constituents if
 their Member of Congress is a climate denier and to put pressure on the de
niers themselves. The campaign includes television ads criticizing Senator 
Ron Johnson, Representative Mike Coffman, Representative Rodney Davis, and 
Representative Dan Benishek for their extreme views in denying the proven s
cience of climate change. LCV is urging their constituents to contact these
 members of Congress to tell them that it's time to act on climate change.
