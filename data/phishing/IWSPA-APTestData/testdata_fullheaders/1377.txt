Hi Amy,

As I mentioned in my previous email, a new approach to loyalty has given our clients a better way of protecting the investments they make to both acquire and retain customers.

What are your plans for the coming year? How much will you spend on customer acquisition? What are you going to spend to retain your customers?




Do you have some time to discuss how we could help you ensure that the investments you make deliver an ROI that's both sustainable and truly measurable?

Best,
Eric

Investing in Acquisition & Retention

In the never-ending debate over where marketing budgets should be allocated, we believe that regardless of how much and where you invest, loyalty should be a key component of ensuring that your investments pay off. A multi-channel loyalty program provides customers with the kinds of incentives that get them engaged and keep them coming back, while also providing marketers with the insights that allow them to more effectively identify and target their various audience segments.
