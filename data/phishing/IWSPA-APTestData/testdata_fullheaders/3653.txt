David Caplan’s passion and enthusiasm for the work of City Year go way beyond being a board member.  He consistently strives to be a resource to corps members and often makes the time to volunteer alongside them.  His outstanding commitment and energy have earned him the title of “Dean of City Year New York.”

David began his commitment to service in 1942 when he joined the U.S. Navy.  He graduated from Notre Dame and received a graduate degree in marketing at Harvard University.  David spent his professional career in the garment industry as President of Concord Fabrics, Evan Piccone and Metro Textiles.  He was honored as “Man of the Year” three times by the textile industry.

Since his retirement, he has found his calling in the field of education. He serves on the boards of PENCIL, WNYC and, of course, City Year.  As a spry 80-something, David admits to being a workaholic for City Year, still spending many hours a week helping carry out its mission at a salary of $1 per year.
