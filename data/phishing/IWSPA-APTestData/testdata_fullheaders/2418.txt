analysis of McCain's McNuke plan today.  The cost to tax payers is as
much as $280B in what we are calling the mother of all sub-prime loans.

  Senator McCain's Nuclear Plan: An Economic and Environmental Disaster

Washington, DC =96 Sen. John McCain's plan to build up to a 100 new nuclear
reactors could cost taxpayers an estimated $280 billion and presents a
significant risk for the economy and the public, while doing little to solv
e
America's energy problems, according to a new report by Environment
America<<<link>>
ection-2008-reports/john-mccain-nuclear-plans>
.

"America needs a new direction on energy, but Sen. McCain's plan would be
serious setback to our economy and to prospects for clean energy," said Ann
a
Aurilio, of Environment America. "These 'McNukes' would super-size our tax
bills, our energy bills and our nuclear waste problems," she added.

Since private investors have been unwilling to finance new nuclear power
plants, the industry has been applying to the federal government for
taxpayer-backed loans. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that these
loans are so risky at least 50 percent would default. Environment America
estimates that taxpayers could be on the hook for $126 billion to $280
billion in failed nuclear loans.

"As the country struggles with an economic meltdown, it's astonishing that
Sen. McCain is proposing massive subprime loans to the nuclear industry,"
said Aurilio. "We've all seen what happens when Wall Street takes foolish
risks, now Sen. McCain's plan asks taxpayers to foot the bill for building
new nuclear plants that even Wall Street has refused to pay for," she added
.

Sen. McCain has repeatedly called for building 45 new nuclear reactors
before 2015 with an ultimate goal of building 100 new plants. Environment
America's report shows:

*A $280 Billion Cost to Taxpayers*: Nuclear plants are enormously expensive
.
The cost of 45 reactors is likely to be at least $315 billion, while 100
reactors would cost at least $700 billion. Under Sen. McCain's plan,
taxpayers are estimated to be on the hook for $126-280 billion in failed
nuclear loans, with the average American household paying $1,100 to more
than $2,400 for failed nuclear loans.

*A Job Creation Fantasy*: New nuclear power plants would create, at best,
one- fourth as many jobs as Sen. McCain claimed during the second
presidential debate, costing taxpayers as much as $19 million for each
permanent job created.

*Failure to Take Advantage of Cleaner, Cheaper Alternatives*:
Clean energy technologies like energy efficient products, super-efficient
buildings and wind and solar power can deliver environmental results and
meet more of our energy needs much sooner than building new nuclear power
plants, and create more jobs at a lower cost to taxpayers=97without the
collateral environmental and security risks.

 Environment America estimates that Sen. McCain's plan would create enough
highly radioactive waste to fill a second Yucca Mountain-sized dump and
dramatically increase the amount of nuclear waste transported on our roads
and rails. The report also concludes that the plan would do nothing to deal
with our current energy crisis since no new power would be generated until
at least 2019.

"Sen. McCain is so vehement about building these nuclear plants that he has
turned a deaf ear to what we just learned about risky loans and how much
they can hurt tax payers," said Aurilio. "This is especially alarming given
Sen. McCain's consistent failure to support the kinds of clean energy
investments that can strengthen our economy and save us money," she
concluded.

Disaster," can be found
