Dear customers:

Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online 
Banking
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we
periodically
review accounts.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts
continue
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or
withdraw
funds.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with
your 
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our
verification
process. You must confirm your domain.com card details and your billing
information
as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information 
unconfirmed,
meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until
you have
updated your billing information on file.

To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the 
link
bellow and fill in the necessary fields:

Thank you,

Wells Fargo - Online Banking
