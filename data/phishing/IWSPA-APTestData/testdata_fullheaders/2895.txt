Right now, with the GOP in charge of Congress, things are more of a circus 
than ever before.

That is why we NEED to ensure that President Obama has the support he 
needs to fight back against the GOP.

We're just 1,523 membership activations away from tonight's goal. But, 
John, your record is still pending. That's why we need you to activate 
your membership...before it's too late.
