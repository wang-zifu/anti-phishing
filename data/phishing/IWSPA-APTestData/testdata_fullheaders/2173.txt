Inside Business Insider: Reverse Engineering a Successful Online News Business

Founded by Henry Blodget in 2007, and having recently attracted two separate investments from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Business Insider is a great example of a new type of online news business that reverses the business model that has underpinned news publishing for decades.

Emboldened by the apparent success of sites like Business Insider, plus others like Huff Post, Gawker, and BuzzFeed the last few months have seen the launch of a new wave of online news businesses; for example Re/Code (Kara Swisher, Walt Mossberg), Vox (Ezra Klein) and The Information (Jessica Lessin) - plus others (see our new report on Newspapers and the domain.com for a full list).

(Indeed, we find this emerging sector so interesting that we're seriously considering launching an online news tech service ourselves, and we'll be inviting you to provide feedback on a pre-beta site we've developed in the coming days...)
