Help a child migrant today during #GivingTuesday

Dear KIND Supporters,

We are excited to share with you that KIND’s innovative Guatemalan Child Return and Reintegration Project (GCRRP) has been accepted to participate in a Microsoft matching program through the Global Giving Site today, on Giving Tuesday!

Starting at noon on December 3rd, $250,000 in matching funds will be available – gifts of $10 to $1,000 per donor, per project will be matched 100 percent by Microsoft UNTIL FUNDS RUN OUT! (It is recommended to domain.com the site between 12:00 and 2:00 p.m. ET as matching funds usually run out in a couple of hours)

This is a wonderful opportunity to help Guatemalan children returning home alone and ensure that they receive vital support in their home communities through KIND’s GCRRP, which has garnered praise and international attention, and could assist many more children with support from people like you.

Please help us take advantage of this chance to tap matching funds for this key KIND initiative by spreading the word to your friends, colleagues and social media networks!  

As the concept of Giving Tuesday grows, people are seeking meaningful ways to give.  Each gift made today* at Global Giving will be matched 1:1, and will help an unaccompanied Guatemalan child return home safely.

Thank you!

Wendy Young
KIND President

*Conditions: 

The match continues until December 4th, 2013, at 11:59:59 AM ET, or until matching funds run out.

Only online donations (domain.com card or PayPal) are eligible for matching funds.

Donations made by gift card, check, or
