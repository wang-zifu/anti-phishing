On - donor v1 -

*         Where it says "It supports President Obama's hard work in the White House." change to something like "It supports the hard work President Obama is achieving in the White House." That way it doesn't sound like we're having donors pay for White House activities.

On the ones that say "You were part of a community of X" how big is that number? How does it compare to our candidates or other committees? I want to make sure we can defend it well.
