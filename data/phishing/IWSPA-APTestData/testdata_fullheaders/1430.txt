Hi Amy,

I work with a lot of companies that struggle with managing sales tax. Two things I usually hear is that the rules from state to state aren’t clear and that the amount of effort to maintain compliance is too much. 

I’m sure you already know that sales tax is tricky—and the departments of revenue aren’t making it any easier. But I have some methods that will help remove the pain and offload much of the work. With the right process and technology, you can streamline the whole thing—from rate calculation, to exemption certificates, to filing and remitting, and more. 




  Will you join us for an hour on Tuesday (August 26) at 2:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT? Here’s a link to reserve your spot.This event is free of charge!Email me with any questions.Cheers!Morgan Coleman  |  Marketing ManagerOffice: (206) 826-4900 x1466
