The tech side of homeland defense

Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland Security, as politicians fret about tech-savvy terrorists--and insist that any new agency must shield the United States from electronic attacks. Meanwhile, the administration says that it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

Studios sue defunct $1 movie site

The movie studio's trade association filed domain.com Tuesday against domain.com, a would-be domain.com video Web site that has allegedly popped up in several incarnations around the world.
Calling the site a "piratical, virtual 'video-on-demand' business," the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its member studios sued the company and an individual allegedly associated with it in a California federal court.

$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down

Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors due to a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems.

Apple to expand iMac LCD display

Apple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger flat-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show, according to sources.
The upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

NextCard cuts off domain.com card customers

Federal regulators on Wednesday deactivated hundreds of thousands of domain.com cards belonging to former customers of NextCard.
The Federal domain.com Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000 accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman. Although NextCard customers will no longer be able to use their cards to make purchase or cash withdrawals, they will continue to be responsible for their outstanding balances.
