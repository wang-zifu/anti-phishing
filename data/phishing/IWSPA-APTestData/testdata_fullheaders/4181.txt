Dear Wells Fargo
                valued customer,

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with Wells Fargo.
 This might be due to either following reasons:

- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)

- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within
our processors.

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your
				Wells Fargo account from a foreign IP address and we have
reasons to believe
                that your account was hijacked by a third party without
your
                authorization. If you recently accessed your account while 
                traveling, the log
                in attempts may have initiated by you.

                However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on 
                the link below and domain.com, as we try to verify your account.

				<>

The log in attempt was made From: "Wells Fargo" <security@wellsfargo.com>

                IP address: 211.72.153.170

                ISP host: 211.72.153.170-mail.tw

                If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no
choice but to
                temporally suspend your account.

                We ask that you allow at least 72hrs for the case to be
investigated and
                we strongly recommend not making any changes to your
account in that
                time.

* Please do not respond to this
email as your
                reply will not be received.

                Thank you for your patience as we work together to protect
your account.
