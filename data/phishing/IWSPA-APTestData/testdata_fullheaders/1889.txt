  Dance 4- Mallory

  Hi Mr. and Mrs. Mosko,

I hope you both are doing well. I am emailing you because I have not seen Mallory in class lately, and I am concerned because she is not completing her assignments. When she is in class she is focused and works hard, and I have really enjoyed watching her improve in her performance. But her assignments are not getting completed. I have sent out canvas messages as reminders and remind them in class, but I am still missing 3 assignments through canvas and her signed syllabus. I will still accept all of these assignments from her if you can help me get her to complete them. We have until the end of the week for first quarter grades, and I would really like to get her grade back up. It is totally possible if she only completes work. Please let me know if there is any other way in which I can help. I will talk to her again in class today if I see her. Thank you!
