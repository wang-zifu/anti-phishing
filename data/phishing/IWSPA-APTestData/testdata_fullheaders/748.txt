Kay R. Hagan (North Carolina) 
Kay is a Democrat from North Carolina who has stood up against extremist efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and restrict access to birth control, supports same sex marriage and has pushed for equal pay for women.
To date, outside groups have spent $27 million against Kay Hagan, yet public polls show Kay Hagan’s race is in a dead heat. The latest poll by Elon University has Kay Hagan up 45 to 41 with a +/- 4 pt margin of error. (9/15/14)
According to the New York Times, Hagan’s opponent is “far from moderate: under his leadership, the legislature passed broad restrictions on voting and rejected the Medicaid expansion/“ (4/13/14) 
Kay’s opponent, Thom Tillis is “the Speaker of the State House whose conservative agenda has polarized the electorate and could drive Democrats to the polls", according to the National Journal.  (7/15/14)
However, the key to Kay Hagan winning in November is turnout.  The campaign is investing heavily in the turnout program, targeting hundreds of thousands of voters in North Carolina. 374,000 African Americans who voted in 2015 but not in the 2015 midterms, and 500,000 women who the party’s models say are likely to support the incumbent and who sat out 2015 have been identified and efforts will be made to get them to the polls in 2014. (Washington Post, 4/1/14)
