   Anti-choice presidential candidate Scott Walker wants to hide his extreme

                          [1]Chip in $15

   Dear John,

   We've discovered the most deadly effective argument against an anti-choi
ce
   presidential candidate like Scott Walker.

   His own words.

   Walker said forced invasive ultrasounds are "just a cool thing" for women
   seeking abortion care.^1

   He's pushing legislation in Wisconsin to ban all abortion after 20
   weeks--and he specifically insisted that the bill NOT include exceptions
   for rape or incest.^2

   These extreme positions are politically toxic--and we're going to make h
im
   own them. So we've launched a TV ad campaign to let people hear them from
   the source. Will you chip in $15 to defend choice and keep
   these ads on the air?

   [2]Yes, I'll chip in $15.

   Every election year, anti-choice candidates try to hide their extreme
   views from the voters--because they know that 7 in 10 Americans support
   abortion rights.

   But we've got them on tape--and, with your help we can make them own the
ir
   words.

   Scott Walker is among the leading Republican candidates in the polls, and
   he's signed on to the anti-choice movement's entire agenda, from abortion
   bans to invasive forced ultrasounds.

   And now he wants to be president of the United States? We won't let that
   happen.

   Will you chip in $15 to defend choice and make sure voters
   know the truth about anti-choice presidential-frontrunner Scott Walker?

   [3]Yes, I'll chip in $15.

   Thank you for helping to make abortion rights real for all women,

   Ilyse G. Hogue
   President, NARAL Pro-Choice America
