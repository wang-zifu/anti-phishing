Hi Mark,

Hope all is well. Was checking to see if you can give me a comment about the chaos at the Nevada state convention over the weekend and the treatement of Roberta Lange, the party chairwoman there, by Sanders supporters. I'm interested in what this means for party unity as the convention approaches.

Thx,
Alan
