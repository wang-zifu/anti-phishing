GABRIELLE is a young woman affected by Williams’ syndrome with an infectious joie de vivre and exceptional musical talent. She met her beloved Martin at the leisure center where they are both members of the choir and they have been inseparable ever since. But because they are different, their nearest and dearest will not allow them to love each other as they wish to. As the group prepares for an important musical festival, Gabrielle does all she can to demonstrate her autonomy and achieve a form of independence. She will need all her determination to outface prejudice and her own limitations if she is to continue her relationship with Martin, in what is a very unusual love story indeed.
