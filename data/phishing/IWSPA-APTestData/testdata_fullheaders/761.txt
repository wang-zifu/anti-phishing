John --

This donor-matching drive ends tonight. To get us where we need to be, and 
with more than 15,000 people joining this matching drive so far this week, 
I'm setting a goal to reach 20,000 before our deadline at midnight.

My team calculated how many new donors this goal translates to in your 
area. Here's where we stand:

GRASSROOTS MATCH
Deadline: Midnight tonight
National Goal: 20,000 new donors
Goal in Washington: 18

One of these people -- maybe even someone in your neighborhood -- will 
make their first donation to the campaign because you're ready to double 
their impact.

Can you help us meet our goal by pledging to match a first-time gift of 
$25?

We know that we can compete without compromising our values -- measuring 
our goals not just in dollars raised, but in people who've taken ownership 
of this campaign.

Donate $25 or more today and help bring in a new donor:

Thanks,
