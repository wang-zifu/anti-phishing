Subject: Door and Parking Lot Access Disruption

Dear Faculty and Staff,

A UIS technical issue caused Faculty and Staff to lose access to doors and 
parking lots using their

GOCards on January first.

GOCard access to parking lots has been fully restored.

GOCard access to most doors has been restored.

If you experience problems accessing doors or parking lots with your GOCard
, please notify us at:

user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>

We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

Sincerely,

Roman Fahrmann
Director of GOCard Services
Georgetown University
