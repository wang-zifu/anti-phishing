tee call

Hi Bob and Alan:  On our steering committee call last week, John user ra
ised the issue of changing trends in the nature of work, which Bob referred
 to as the "casualization" of work and is sometimes called the "on-demand" 
economy, 1099 economy, Uberization, etc...   We have been following these t
rends and are interested in the potential implications (e.g. on issues like
 the safety net, bargaining power over wages/benefits, distribution of weal
th, consumer protections, etc...).  The issue seems to be getting more popu
lar media attention, but the policy landscape seems stuck in a different er
a.

Herb and I spoke briefly with John yesterday about what else might be done.

*        On the policy side, John is encouraging CAP to be more engaged, wh
ich Neera wants to do.  We think CAP plans to start by doing one or more po
licy-oriented convenings, and then decide what else to do.   I have spoken 
with CBPP to encourage them to reflect further on how these developments ma
y impact the safety net policies they work on, both federally and in the st
ates.  For example, some of their key policy issues, such as the EITC, are 
often dependent on traditional "employment" to receive the benefits.

*        We're not sure how much serious academic work is being done in thi
s area.  From the steering committee call, Alan noted that Alan Krueger is 
doing a paper on Uber and we know Heather hopes the RFP may yield some rele
vant research projects.  I also plan to reach out to Rob Johnson to see if 
INET or its network are thinking about these topics.

We'd be interested in:

o   Your thoughts on whether it would make sense to try and convene some ac
ademics on the topic, including to understand where there might be disagree
ment among them

o   Whether such a convening might be done through WCEG, or might be better
 done separately

o   Any other thoughts you may have for how to pursue this topic further in
 the academy, and whether it is a worthwhile domain.com

It probably makes sense to try and have a brief call by phone, rather than 
do this by email.  Herb and I are pretty flexible the rest of this week, an
d also the week of Nov 16-20.  Would any times work for you in those window
s?  John would try and join the call, schedule permitting.

As background, if interested, here are a couple items that provide a pretty
 good overview of some of the issues:

*        Sen. Mark Warner, who is interested in the topic, wrote an op ed<h
ttps://domain.com/opinions/asking-tough-questions-about-the-gig
-economy/2015/06/18/b43f2d0a-1461-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html> in the
 Washington Post.

*        The Economist<<<link>>

ad a survey piece on this topic of freelance workers that covered a broad r
ange of issues

Thank you.
