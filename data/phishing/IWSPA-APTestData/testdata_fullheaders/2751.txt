Lisa,

Per a conversation with John user, would you please arrange a conferen
ce call between John user, David Brock, Mary Pat Bonner, Kim Anderson 
and me to discuss funding for ProgressNow and its affiliates @ 5pm EDT to
morrow.

Background

John and I talked on Friday about PMUSA and NEA funding for ProgressNow.

Mary Pat and I talked this weekend about other subjects but she indicated
=20that she was now representing ProgressNow and has some insight into th
eir funding needs.

John user had suggested we talk @ 5pm tomorrow, so I am setting up a c
onference call. I am including Mary Pat. Please let Lisa know if you can 
be on?
