Fwd: A New Fantasy from David Baldacci

We preemptively optioned this young adult fantasy book last month from bestselling author David Baldacci. Just wanted to share some of the early marketing/plans for the book. Scholastic is putting a lot of energy behind launching it next year. Walmart has apparently bought in big on the book and will be selling an exclusive version that will include some of the British illustrations, as well as a bunch of "extras." The British publisher, Macmillan Children's Books, has an amazing marketing plan in place. They ended their presentation to Baldacci and his agent by saying, "There is basically nothing else that we can do for a book - marketing, store placement, advertising, etc." Another note on the U.K. publication: they will be releasing the book a few days before the American edition because of Tesco. I didn't realize this, but to be a bestseller in the U.K. a book must be in Tesco. Since they're primarily a grocery store, they only have certain slots available at certain times - hence the publishers have to take the slots whenever they're available close to their publication date. Lastly, there was a big publishing auction for the book in Brazil recently between four publishing houses. Apparently that's unusual in Brazil. Things are definitely on track for the book. Publishers are really stepping up worldwide. I'll keep you apprised of any other developments as I hear them.
