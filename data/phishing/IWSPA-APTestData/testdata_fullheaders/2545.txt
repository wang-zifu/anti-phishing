 press, Donald Trump today on Sean Hannity Radio spoke highly of his favori
te outlet, the National Enquirer.

TRUMP: And then in the meantime, as you know, there was a picture a few wee
ks ago, it was all over the place, that Lee Harvey Oswald and his father a 
few months before=85

HANNITY: Was that verified before=85.I saw something on the domain.com

TRUMP: It was a picture put in=85and they wouldn=92t put it in if they coul
dn=92t be sued, that I can tell you. They are very big professionals. It wa
s put in, and by the way, Ted Cruz I don=92t think denied it at the news co
nference. They don=92t do things unless they can be verified.

So if that is the case=85
