Become a Tour de Summer Camps Sponsor

Tour de Summer Camps    




         Dear Amy,

 <<link>> it or not, summer is already here and that means Jewish camps are in full swing. As a former camper myself, I could not be more thrilled about our Federation’s 2nd annual Tour de Summer Camps  on September 21st.  Thanks to our community riders, virtual fundraisers and generous sponsors, the first Tour de Summer Camps netted over $500,000—making it possible for our Federation to help send more than 1,500 kids to camp this season. Without our assistance, the cost would be out of reach for most families.

This year, we want to top that number and we need your help. We are seeking additional sponsors for this year’s event. Sponsorship provides companies and organizations with outstanding exposure to our entire Jewish community as well as cycling enthusiasts throughout the Los Angeles area. With a host of sponsorship opportunities available, there’s an option that’s right for you. And, most importantly, proceeds will help us send more of our kids to Jewish summer camp where they will build a lifelong connection to Jewish life.

If you’re interested in becoming a sponsor, or know someone who is, click here to download our Sponsorship Brochure.

For more information, contact Inbar Sharon at user@domain.com

Of course, I also encourage you to sign up to ride as an individual, join a team or start your own!

No matter how you choose to participate in Tour de Summer Camps, you’ll make a significant impact on the children in our community and on our shared Jewish future!

Have a great summer,

Julie Platt
