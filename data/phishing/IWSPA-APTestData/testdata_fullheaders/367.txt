t r u t h o u t | Matters are coming to a head in these United States. The president has very quietly escalated our war in Afghanistan again, even as he tiptoes toward deeper and more lethal engagement in Iraq. Here at home, militarized police cut down unarmed teenagers with no consequences and those protesting injustice are vilified as the shooters walk free. 

Truthout is devoted to the task of informing you so that you may stand against what has gone so terribly wrong, but the clock is running, and we desperately need your help. We're still $9,000 away from meeting our goal. We've extended our fundraising drive as far as we can, so you have one last chance to contribute - please make it count.
