Summer Video: Hope Beyond a Meal & Care

Dear Amy,

In four short days the summer season will officially begin. With summer comes the heat, hunger and hygiene problems faced by thousands of men, women and children on the streets of Los Angeles. While giving to the Los Angeles Mission will be at an annual low, we fully anticipate a record number of people coming through our doors needing hope and that literal “cup of cold water in Jesus’ name.”



As you’ll see in this video, that’s exactly what you’re providing when you give a gift to the Los Angeles Mission. Please prayerfully consider a generous gift today so that men and women like these can find hope beyond a meal and care this summer. And when you give now, you gift will be doubled. Please
