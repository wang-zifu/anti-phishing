Dear Friend,

The Muhlenberg College tracking poll out this morning, and the final poll to be released before the election, has the race:

Sestak 44% - Specter 44%, with 11% undecided.

It's "gut-check" time ? we've fought "tooth and nail" to get this race to this point, with two days to go, against a 30-year incumbent who is backed by the Washington and Pennsylvania establishments.

We're locked in a fierce battle ? with less than 48 hours remaining before Pennsylvanians go to the polls.  We really need your help to win this!

This morning the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported "this Senate race is being watched in many parts of the world," while the Pittsburgh Post Gazette reported, "Arlen didn't count on this":

"... a surge from two-term U.S. Rep. Sestak, the retired three-star Admiral from suburban Philadelphia who is staking a claim as the only true Democrat in the race.

Mr. Sestak is an unapologetic liberal with a voting record to prove it. As former commander of an aircraft carrier battle group, he has tough-guy credentials that few politicians on either side of the aisle can match. And like any good military strategist, he saw an opening and moved to domain.com it.

Grass-roots Democrats did not like having Mr. Specter shoved down their throats. So, in a skillful and well-financed end run around the Democratic establishment, Mr. Sestak has been taking his case directly to the voters.

He's been making appearances all over the state and flooding the airwaves with ads that contrast their voting records, showing his own as far more in line with Democratic principles ? the overall strategy has been working ...

This is the kind of bruising primary Mr. Specter thought he'd avoid by switching parties. Now it turns out that the Democrats may not want him anymore than the Republicans did."

And the Philadelphia Inquirer just reported out this morning the "walls are closing in" on Arlen Specter!

Please make a quick donation -- as generous as you can be -- we need every dollar!  We've got less than 48 hours to move the undecided voters to support Joe!  (The quicker a donation is made, the quicker we increase the frequency our closing ads are broadcast.)

Our ten offices across the state are over-flowing with volunteers streaming in to phone bank, while our neighborhoods are filled with volunteers canvassing. Please support their passionate efforts!

It's time to bring this race on home!
