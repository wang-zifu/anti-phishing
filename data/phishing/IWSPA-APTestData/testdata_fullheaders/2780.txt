Hi Leah,




As a follow up to the Japanese Ministerial domain.com next week, I understand Minister Yamamoto (his domain.com is Okinawa and Northern Territories) would like to have lunch here prior to his tour of the lot…  Lynton will welcome him, but will likely not join the lunch.  Given the size of his delegation, I can have three people from our side included….  He wants to talk generally about the history of production, our views of the Japanese market, and how people come to work in this sector.  My thought was you, me, and one other (either theatrical dist, TV, or production admin)




Are you able/willing?  Of course, I’d shoot you a brief before the meeting (including the latest on TPP, etc.)




Let me know…




Thanks! 




KW
