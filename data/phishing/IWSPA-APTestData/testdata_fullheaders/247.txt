FFA friends,

We have several organizations in the movement who are c4s with MCFL status. Our c4 is one, VoteVets is another, LCV and a few others.

We have a really important need to inflate the primary purpose spending for those groups. The best way to do that would be to use 2-3 of the groups to receive all of the c4 money and then have them re-grant it to other c4s--ACORN, etc.

This is the most strategic use of the money because just less than half of a c4 MCFL's annual revenue can be hard money.

I only raise this since it doesn't seem to be happening. It was one of the things George Rakis and I discussed when talking Atlas this week.

-Tom.
