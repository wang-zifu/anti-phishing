Dear John,

In years past, during the holidays, we've been able to raise
tens of thousands of dollars for charities that help our troops
and veterans, and I can tell you that they're all so grateful
for your support. This year, we want to raise even more for the
Bill Cahir Memorial Fund, and hope you can donate whatever you
can afford.

To remind you, Bill Cahir was a Marine, veteran, and one of our
endorsed candidates. In the spring of 2009, he was deployed to
Afghanistan, where he made the ultimate sacrifice. Bill left
behind a wife and unborn twin daughters. Those girls never will
get to meet their father. But, the Cahir Memorial Fund was
established to help his wife provide for their little girls.

Bill didn't have to serve this nation in uniform. In fact, he
wouldn't have even been recruited to do so. See, Bill was a
journalist on September 11, 2001, but felt the call of duty so
strongly that he applied for an age waiver to join the Marines
and go to war. Bill was 34 then. He went back to war again, and
again, when called. It was on his third tour that he died in
Afghanistan's Helmand Province.

Donating to the Bill Cahir Memorial Fund will make sure that his
daughters receive as good a quality of life as they can without
their father there. It will help with everything from basic
needs to college. 

Ultimately, those girls will carry on the ideals that Bill stood
for and that his widow, Rene, will instill in them. So your help
will go to a very worthy cause.
