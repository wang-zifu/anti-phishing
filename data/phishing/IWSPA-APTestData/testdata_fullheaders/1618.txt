Dear Professor user,

I apologize again for my absence on Monday to attend the funeral for
my wife's grandmother.  I very much appreciate your understanding.  As
promised, I simply wanted to follow up with a more refined paper
topic:

I have looked more closely into the role of the House Un-American
Activities Committee during the late 1930s.  One of the most
interesting features of the Committee was its struggle with the
Roosevelt administration over access to executive agency reports and
personnel (particularly from the FBI) to investigate suspected Nazi
activists in the United States.  After being rebuffed by the Roosevelt
administration, the Committee hired its own investigators to
infiltrate the German-American Bund, a crypto-fascist organization in
the United States.  In light of this interesting tension between the
executive and legislative branches and the Committee's aggressive
efforts to conduct its own domestic intelligence operations during the
late 1930s, I am now conceiving of the paper as a case study that
explores the boundaries between executive and legislative power in the
context of a congressional investigation.

I am happy to talk about the paper topic further on Monday, but simply
wanted to send you an update as I was unable to attend class this
week.

Thank you again for all of your assistance and for your flexibility.

Best regards,
Eric Steinhart
