John --

In your neighborhood and in thousands of communities across the country, 
Americans are answering President-elect Obama's call to service.

Tomorrow, January 19th, our nation will come together in a shared domain.com 
of community. And I wanted to make sure you know how to participate.

Monday is not only the eve of an inauguration that brings all of us so 
much hope, it's also Martin Luther King Jr. Day -- when we recognize the 
power of one man to bring about change by serving his country.

Help kick off an ongoing commitment to serve our communities by taking 
part in this extraordinary day of service.

Sign up to attend or host an event in your community and help rebuild 
America one neighborhood at a time:

The grassroots movement you helped build was always about more than an 
election.  It's about bringing much needed change to Washington and our 
communities.

Barack is calling on us to help rebuild our country. He knows what can 
happen when ordinary people turn their hopes into real action.

Take the first step this Monday, January 19th, by joining a service event 
near you.  Sign up now:

Thanks,

David
