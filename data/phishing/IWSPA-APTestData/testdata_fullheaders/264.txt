Hey Zac, hope your weekend has started off well. 

One line of argument I think we may want to push re Trump's tax returns is that if he's currently under domain.com, it's even more important that voters have a chance to see his filings. 

The fact he is routinely audited is probably not due to persecution by the IRS, but instead because he is pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable. Trump is likely exploiting loopholes and engaging in accounting tricks, things that hard-working families don't/can't do. The American people deserve to see what the government finds concerning and, more generally, how far he will go not to pay his fair share.
