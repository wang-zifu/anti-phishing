Subject: Katie Wrede

Dear Colleagues,

I  am writing to share with you the news that after four and a half years o
f top notch, dedicated service to my office and the entire Law Center commu
nity, Katie Wrede is concluding her time as my executive assistant.  As man
y of you may know, in Fall 2012, Katie was admitted to the Law Center's eve
ning program.  Since then, she has been supporting my office full time whil
e at the same time working diligently as a law student.  Katie will begin h
er final year this Fall, and will now be able to focus full time on her stu
dies and her life and career beyond law school.  Katie's last day working i
n the office will be tomorrow, Friday, May 15th<x-apple-data-detectors://0>
, having concluded another year of meritorious service as we move on to thi
s year's graduation ceremonies.

Since her arrival in December 2010, Katie has been an integral part of my s
taff. As you know, she welcomed numerous visiting guests, scheduled (and of
ten rescheduled!) countless meetings, and managed my calendar, itself a mov
ing target.  Katie's professionalism and grace in the face of the constant 
flow of activity and changes in plans are both indicative of her dedication
 to the Law Center and a tribute to her.  I thank Katie for her exceptional
 support these past years, and will miss her.

Please join me in thanking and congratulating Katie on her contributions to
 the Law Center and wishing her well on her final year in law school.

Sincerely,

Bill
