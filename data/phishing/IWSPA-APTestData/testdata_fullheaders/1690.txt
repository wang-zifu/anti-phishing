Cruz to Focus Campaign=92s Time and Resources in Indiana, Allow Kasich to F
ocus on Oregon and New Mexico

HOUSTON, Texas =96 Cruz for President Campaign Manager Jeff Roe today relea
sed the following statement:

=93Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure
 disaster for Republicans. Not only would Trump get blown out by Clinton or
 Sanders, but having him as our nominee would set the party back a generati
on. To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Pa
rty and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in 
Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and
 New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow o
ur lead. In other states holding their elections for the remainder of the p
rimary season, our campaign will continue to compete vigorously to win.=94
