Hello All,
Just got off the phone with our tracker, Jacob, on the ground in Pottsville.
Below are the notes from our call.

Big Highlights*
*

   - Says Obama is running to be Redistributionist in Chief. I'm running to
   be Commander in Chief.
   - Repeats (slimmed-down) attack on Obama for saying in a radio interview
    that one of the "tragedies" of the civil rights movement is that it didn't
   bring about "redistributive change."
      - Says Obama said that even though lower taxes on investment help our
      economy,  he favors higher taxes on investment for "fairness" -- "There's
      nothing "fair" about driving our economy into the ground."
      - Repeats that Obama's more interested in controlling wealth than in
      creating it
   - Scoffs at Obama for saying we should look at environmental concerns,
   etc. when considering nuclear power

Pottsville, PA: McCain Rally 10/27/08
(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes. If you'd like a
quotable transcript or video of any part below, please email us.)

Background details

   - about 4000 ppl, VERY enthusiastic crowd
   - Tracker saw about 30 demonstrators outside pre-event yelling 'Tell Your
   Mama Vote Obama!'
   - State Reps. Gary Hornberger and Dave Argall give brief intro remarks:
   Obama will tax and spend
   - Cindy intros mccain
      - you make my heart so warm
      - when we started on this 18mo. ago it was a family affair [someone
      yells cindy's hot?]
      - we had a vested interest in iraq - our son was there
      - leadership and character to be pres - he has always put his country
      first
      - lived his life by code of conduct - duty honor - what a wonderful
      pres. he'll make

Speech Highlights
*TY. wont cindy make a great FLOTUS? and wont palin make a great VP? shes
smart, tough, reformer, wonderful family person and she'll take on old boy
netwrk of DC. ty for your enthusiastic support of her. Todd is 4x snow
mobile champ. think anyone in DC coudl scare him or her?

lets start out with a msg tonight: we need to win PA. i need your help over
next 8 days so we can bring real change to DC.

some ST: we cant spend next 4 yrs as weve spent last 8. we have to act, we
need a new direction and we have to fight for it. ive been fighting ofr this
country since i was 17 and i ahve the scars to prove it.

I have a plan to hold the line on taxes and cut them to make America more
competitive and create jobs here at home. no one knows better than you in PA
how badly we need to create jobs and get our econ. going again. We're going
to double the child deduction for working families. We will cut the capital
gains tax. And we will cut business taxes to help create jobs, and keep
American businesses in America. [john mccain! john mccain!]

Raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse. Keeping taxes low creates
jobs, keeps money in your hands and strengthens our economy.

If I'm elected President, I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of
your money. Senator Obama will. And he can't do that without raising your
taxes or digging us further into debt. I'm going to make government live on
a budget just like you do.

I will freeze government spending on all but the most important programs
like defense, veterans care, Social Security and health care until we scrub
every single government program and get rid of the ones that aren't working
for the American people. And I will veto every single pork barrel bill
Congresses passes. DNA of bears or whatever - you will know their names, i
will make them famous.

I'm not going to spend $750 billion dollars of your money just bailing out
the Wall Street bankers and brokers who got us into this mess. I'm going to
make sure we take care of the working people who were devastated by the
excesses of Wall Street and Washington.

I have a plan to fix our housing market, so that your home value doesn't go
down when your neighbor defaults, and so that people in danger of defaulting
have a path to pay off their loan. so that ppl can achieve american dream of
owning a home.

If I'm elected-- when im elected President, we're going to stop spending
$700 billion to buy oil from countries that don't like us very much.

in the debate the other night, i talked about how much i admired obama's
rhetoric. but you listen to whats behind his words. he said he would
"consider" offshore drilling. we talked about nucl, and he said well you
have to consider the enviro, and -- that's right, drill baby drill. We will
invest in all energy alternatives -- nuclear, wind, solar, and tide. We will
encourage the manufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. We
will invest in clean coal technology. let me remind you: the USA sits on
worlds largest coal reserves - we can do clean coal and create millions of
jbos. i see a few old navy vets - there's 1 from my old ship - we've sailed
navy ships around the world w/ nucl plants on them. the french, the
japanese, the british. they store and reprocess. 80% of french energy comes
from nuclear. We will lower the cost of energy within months, and we will
create millions of new jobs. millions

you know, We've learned more about Senator Obama's real goals for our
country over the last two weeks than we learned over the past two years, and
that only because Joe the plumber asked him a question in Ohio. That's when
Senator Obama revealed -- but not for the first time -- he wants to quote
"spread the wealth around."

Now, Joe didn't ask for Senator Obama to come to his house, and he didn't
ask to be famous. He certainly didn't ask for the political attacks on him
from the Obama campaign. Joe's dream is your dream --  to own a small
business that will create jobs, and the attacks on him are an attack on
small businesses all over the country. Small businesses employ 84 percent of
Americans, and we need to support small businesses, not tax them.

After months of campaign trail eloquence, we've finally learned what Senator
Obama's economic goal is: to spread the wealth. In a radio interview
revealed today, he said the same thing -- that one of the "tragedies" of the
civil rights movement is that it didn't bring about "redistributive change."

You see, Senator Obama believes in redistributing wealth, not in policies
that grow our economy and create jobs. He said that even though lower taxes
on investment help our economy, he favors higher taxes on investment for
quote "fairness." There's nothing "fair" about driving our economy into the
ground. We all suffer when that happens, and that is the problem with
Senator Obama's approach to our economy. He is more interested in
controlling wealth than in creating it ... in redistributing money instead
of spreading opportunity. I am going to create wealth for all Americans, by
creating opportunity for all Americans.

Senator Obama is running to be Redistributionist in Chief. I'm running to be
Commander in Chief. Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I'm
running to create more wealth. Senator Obama is running to punish the
successful. I'm running to make everyone successful.

My opponent's massive new tax increase is exactly the wrong approach in an
economic slowdown. The answer to a slowing economy is not higher taxes, but
that is exactly what is going to happen when the Democrats have total
control of Washington. [boos, someone yells something about "spending!"] We
can't let that happen. We need pro-growth and pro-jobs economic policies,
not pro-government spending programs paid for with higher taxes.

This is the fundamental difference between Senator Obama and me. We both
disagree with President Bush on economic policy. The difference is that he
thinks taxes have been too low, and I think that spending has been too high.

If we are going to change Washington, we need a President who has actually
fought for change and male it happen. The next President won't have time to
get used to the office. We face many challenges here at home, and many
enemies abroad in this dangerous world. i will bring our troops home in
victory and honor and not in defeat.

just the other day, a couple days ago, Senator Biden warned a group of
fatcat contributors out on the W. Coast -- he warned us that Senator Obama
would be tested with an international crisis. I have been tested. Senator
Obama hasn't. i know how to work with our friends and i know how to treat
our enemies. biden is the gift that keeps on giving.

Senator Biden referred to how Jack Kennedy was tested in the Cuban Missile
Crisis and I have a little personal experience in that. I was on board the
U.S.S. Enterprise, and I sat in a domain.com on the flight deck waiting to take
off. We had a target. I know how close we came to a nuclear war and I will
not be a president that needs to be tested.

We know Senator Obama won't have the right response to that test, because
we've seen the wrong response from him over and over during this campaign.
He opposed the surge strategy that is bringing us victory in Iraq and will
bring us victory in Afghanistan. He said he would sit down unconditionally
with the world's worst dictators. [boos] When Russia invaded Georgia, Sen.
Obama said the invaded country should show restraint. He's been wrong on all
of these. When I am president, we are going to win in Iraq and win in
Afghanistan, and our troops will come home in victory and honor.

Let me give you a little straight talk. Let me give you the state of the
race today. There's eight days to go. We're a few points down. The pundits
have written us off, just like they've done before. My opponent is working
out the details with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid of their plans [boos]
to raise your taxes, increase spending, and concede defeat in Iraq. He's
measuring the drapes, and he's planned his first address to the nation for
before the election. [yelling, incl. "let the ppl have a vote!"] I guess I'm
old fashioned about these things -- I prefer to let the voters weigh in
before presuming the outcome.

What America needs now is someone who will finish the race before the
starting the victory lap, someone who will fight to the end, and not for
himself but for his country.

I have fought for you most of my life, and in places where defeat meant more
than returning to the Senate. [yelling] There are other ways to love this
country, but I've never been the kind to back down when the stakes are high.

let me just say to you, I know you're worried. [yelling] America is a great
country, but we are at a moment of national crisis that will determine our
future.

Let me ask you a few questions real quickly. Will we continue to lead the
world's economies or will we be overtaken? Will the world become safer or
more dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world? Will
our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours?

My answer to you is yes. Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we
will be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better
country. But we must be prepared to act swiftly, boldly, with courage and
wisdom.

I'm an American. You are Americans, and we choose to fight. Don't give up
hope. Be strong. Have courage. And fight. [usa! usa!]

Fight for a new direction for our country. Fight for what's right for
America.

Fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in
Washington.

Fight to get our country and our economy out of the ditch and back in the
lead.

Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.

Fight for your children's future.

Fight for justice and opportunity for all.

Stand up to defend our country from its enemies.

Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for.
Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never domain.com. We never hide
from history. We make history.

Now, let's go out win this election in PA and get this country moving
again.

God bless you, god bless you all, and god bless the USA.
