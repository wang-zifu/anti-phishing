Dear Friends,
In 2015, as the Cuban and American flags rose in the breeze of diplomacy an
d engagement,
we had an amazing vantage point - seeing the changes from the inside and sh
aring
 what we learned and what we believed with all of you.
We are grateful to the leaders and believers who made all of this possible.
Among them, we want to recognize diplomats at the U.S. State Department in 
Washington
and in our new U.S. Embassy in Havana who encouraged our work and, from tim
e to
time, made us a part of theirs.
We thank our friends in Congress, old and new, who came away from our trips
 to Cuba
inspired and energized to change U.S. policy, Governors like Andrew Cuomo o
f New
 York who capitalized on President Obama's opening to partner with Cuba and
 create
economic opportunity in their states, and the businesses and artists, exper
ts and
advocates, who looked to us so they too could become part of this historic 
change.
We are grateful to the Cubans - especially the amazing women who are centra
l to
much of our work - who welcomed us in Havana, Regla, Pinar del Rio, Cojimar
 and
elsewhere; they shared their stories and aspirations with our eleven delega
tions,
so we could better understand Cuba by listening and exchanging with them.
We were, to paraphrase Tennyson, a part of all that we met.
In just a few days from now, we'll be accompanying a delegation led by Gove
rnor
Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.   After food sales to Cuba were legalized in 2
000,
Virginia was one of the first states to forge a relationship with Cuba, and
 overtime
became one of its most reliable suppliers.   Governor McAuliffe has spent y
ears,
 outside and inside government, engaging with Cuba, hosting its diplomats i
n Virginia
and visiting Cuba.   When he returns to Havana, he will be, to say the leas
t, a
known commodity to our Cuban hosts.
Our country spent decades using food as a weapon of foreign policy against 
Cuba.
   Even after 2000, the weight of U.S. sanctions prevented a full, two-way 
trade
 relationship in agriculture products that would have made it easier for Cu
bans
to put food on their tables and bring Cuban agricultural products into our 
supermarkets
and stores.

report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture makes clear, changes in U.S.
 policy
are needed so that Cuba and the U.S. can resume normal agricultural trade, 
allowing
Cuban and American farms to prosper.
No other sector of the U.S. economy has agitated for better relations - mor
e patiently
or effectively -  and worked harder to bring the United States and Cuba tog
ether
 than American agriculture.
To drive the process of normalization and engagement forwarded, the U.S. bu
siness
community and others could hardly do better than following the example set 
by our
farmers.
We hope you have been enjoying the happiest, safest, and most joyful of hol
idays.
Happy New Year!
