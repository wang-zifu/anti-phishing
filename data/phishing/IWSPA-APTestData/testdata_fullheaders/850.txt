Hey April, another reason we're asking for a plan, talking points, etc. is 
to be prepared for the avalanche of questions we're going to get as soon as
 this goes public, either by us or if someone else leaks it before then (wh
ich is growing more likely). I've already gotten more than a dozen requests
 for more info, so this will be big even though it's Friday. Thanks again f
or all your help. Best, Mark
