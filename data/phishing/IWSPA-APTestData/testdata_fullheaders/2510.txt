John --

Last week, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell got all 41 
GOP senators to promise to oppose Wall Street reform. He thought President 
Obama would back down in the face of a unified show of force.

He was wrong.

Instead, the President stood in front of Wall Street bankers yesterday, 
going to bat for consumers and confronting the toughest of crowds with a 
strong message: Reform is good for Americans, good for the market, and 
it's time to get on board.

Bipartisan discussions have begun again -- but Wall Street lobbyists are 
still swarming Capitol Hill, trying to trip up negotiations and maintain 
the gridlock that has defined Washington for far too long.

So now, it's up to us. We need to show Senate Republicans that the 
American people are watching closely to see whose side they end up on.

Tell Sen. McConnell to stop standing in the way of desperately needed 
change to win favor with your Wall Street allies:

The President laid out a bold plan to hold Wall Street accountable, to 
protect American taxpayers by ensuring they'll never again be asked to 
bail out a big firm "too big to fail," and to put in place the strongest 
consumer financial protections ever proposed.

But this fight isn't just about fixing Wall Street. It's also about fixing 
Washington.

For too long, it's been a place where special interests have set the rules 
and petty partisanship has stood in the way of progress. As the President 
said yesterday, "We can and must put this kind of cynical politics aside."

Thanks to strong leadership from the President and Democrats in Congress, 
the gridlock is starting to crack, and Republicans are slowly giving signs 
that they'll come on board. The Senate has even scheduled a preliminary 
vote for Monday at 5:15 p.m.

But Wall Street lobbyists are flooding in to firm up opposition -- trying 
to carve out loopholes and exemptions for big banks and lenders who have 
long exploited consumers.

The only sure-fire way to make sure that the special interests don't get 
their way is to show Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans that Americans 
are standing firmly with the President. Tell them to join us to fight for 
American families who are counting on reform, not the big Wall Street 
banks. Send a letter today:

Thanks,

Mitch
