Dear Nancy: 
Thanks so much for taking the time to meet with me and  share your thoughts 
on the upcoming health care reform debate.  It is  helpful for me to have 
the domain.com of your perspective as a well-regarded  disability advocate. 
I also wanted to  let you know that as a cosponsor of the Community Choice 
Act in the 110th  Congress, I support the goals of this legislation and can 
assure you that I will  keep our shared priorities foremost in mind as the 
Energy and Commerce Committee  moves forward with a reform package. 
Again, thank you  for contacting me and I hope you will continue to keep in 
touch  on matters of concern. 
With kind regards,  I am 
Sincerely, 
HENRY A. WAXMAN 
Member of Congress
