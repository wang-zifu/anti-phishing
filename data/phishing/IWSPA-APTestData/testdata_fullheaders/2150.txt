Had a great

phone call with Zimmer and explained the complications and that it would be different if this had been brought up when we were negotiating his services originally. I explained that the rationale for the substantial increases in each of his deals subsequent to the original 200K for TLAM included his continuing and growing social media services which I have been witness to and Kevin has kept me aware of during the shooting of those films.Â  To come back now to ask for an extra million dollars for those services would be better justified if it was constructed in the deals based on performance of the film as it achieves levels of success rather than pre-paying for services which have not been rendered and upon which a random monetary value is assigned. He said he saw the domain.com in my reasoning and he would discuss it with the team and get back to me with a response. I emphasized that we are not opposed to rewarding his massive and effective publicity efforts but we cannot negotiate them as part of his acting services because it is a prepayment for future services not yet rendered and not based on actual results. I told him we have no problem negotiating them into his back end that he would receive in success. He will get back to me. I wanted to make sure that he doesn't portray the conversation negatively to Kevin and Dave Becky. I will keep you posted.
