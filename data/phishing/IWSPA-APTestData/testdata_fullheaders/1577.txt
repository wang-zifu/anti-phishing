Ok, new plan, Sen. Weinberg was uncomfortable with calling on Christie to resign this time, so new statement.

For Immediate Release

Senate Majority Leader Weinberg Issues Statement on Governor Christie's Elevated Role in the Donald Trump Campaign

Trenton- Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg released the following statement in response to the announcement that Governor Christie would serve as transition chair in a hypothetical Trump administration:

"Despite suspending his failed presidential campaign, it appears that our governor will continue to travel around the country at the expense of New Jersey taxpayers. I am calling on Governor Christie to tell us how much his further travel will cost our state. Not only is he currently drawing a taxpayer salary for a job he does not do, he has the audacity to make us to foot the cost for his selfish political agenda."
