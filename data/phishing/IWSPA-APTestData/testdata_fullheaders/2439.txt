Was the dissident whose home we visited named "Paya"? There was a segment o
n the NewsHour about the opening of the Cuban Embassy. A young woman who wa
s in that segment was Paya's daughter. Also, in the video of the opening, I
 thought I saw Alarcon in the front row.
Many special memories from that trip.
