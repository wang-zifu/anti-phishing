John -

Comprised mostly of Japanese-American soldiers from Hawaii -- many who had 
families interned during World War II -- the 442nd Regimental Combat Team 
is the most decorated domain.com in the history of the United States military.

With over 18,000 individual decorations, their motto was "Go for 
Broke."

Famed U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye was a member of the 442nd. Hawaii Senator 
Daniel Akaka also during World War II as part of the Army Corps of 
Engineers.

With our help, Iraq War Veteran Mark Takai will carry on their legacy of 
service in the United States Congress.

Mark is running in a Democratic Primary against ultra-conservative 
Democrat Donna Kim, and polls show the race is a dead heat.

We're running a powerful ad in Hawaii that shares Mark's story ahead of 
August 8th primary. We hope you'll watch it and help keep it on the air 
with a contribution today.

Two years ago, VoteVets endorsed a long-shot Iraq War veteran running to 
serve Hawaii's other Congressional District. With our support, she won a 
tough primary against another conservative Democrat and has gone to 
faithfully represent Hawaii's 116,000 veterans in the effort to end our 
wars abroad and improve their care at home.

But through all of Congresswoman Gabbard's distinguished work, we still 
know her as Tulsi.

Right now, there are 16 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans serving in Congress, 
and we have a chance to add one more -- Mark Takai --  a progressive 
candidate who will fight to provide equality of opportunity for veterans, 
military family members, and all Americans.

Watch our ad about Mark Takai and contribute to help keep it on the 
air:

Hawaii's First Congressional District represents Pearl Harbor, and it 
should have a veteran in the seat to represent the needs and requirements 
of the families who comprise the area.

Let's Go for Broke for Mark Takai,

Jon Soltz
Iraq War Veteran and Chairman
