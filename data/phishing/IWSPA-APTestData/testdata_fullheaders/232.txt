And finally here are DOMA talking points from several years ago I did for pr
esident Clinton, which give a complete historical perspective.  (Sorry for a
ll the emails).

The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was a key strategic

element of the Republican Party presidential campaign plan of that year.

=E2=80=9CThe vehicle for Mr. Dole's mischief is the so-called Defense of Mar
riage Act, of which he is a lead co-sponsor in the Senate. =E2=80=A6The legi
slation's only real agenda, of course, is to turn same-sex marriage, hardly t
he year's most pressing issue, into a flashpoint for a polarizing culture wa
r in which gay people become the Willie Hortons of '96. The bill also forces
 Mr. Clinton, who says he opposes both same-sex marriage and anti-gay discri
mination, into a corner. If he vetoes it, his opponents can portray him as a
 proponent of same-sex marriage; if he signs it, he endorses the gay-bashing
 that the bill transparently is. He's presumably praying it will never reach
 his desk.=E2=80=9D  Frank Rich, A Gay-Rights Victory Muffled, The New York T
imes, May 22, 1996.

=E2=80=9CMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole is preparing to use Pres

President Clinton =E2=80=93 the first president ever to support gay rights =E2
=80=93

had also been on record since at least 1992 as opposed to same-sex marriage.

=E2=80=9CMr. Clinton has long supported gay rights, solicited financial supp
ort from homosexuals and paid a heavy price for his effort to end the ban on
 homosexuals in the military. =E2=80=A6George Stephanopoulos, a senior Presi
dential adviser who has overseen the issue, said: =E2=80=9CIt's wrong for pe
ople to use this issue to demonize gays and lesbians and it's pretty clear t
hat that was the intent in trying to create a buzz on this issue. But the fa
ct remains that if the legislation is in accord with the President's stated p
osition, he would have no choice but to sign it.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=9D Todd S. P
urdum, President Would Sign Legislation Banning Homosexual Marriages, The Ne
w York Times, May 23, 1996.

President Clinton was an outspoken critic of the motives behind DOMA.

=E2=80=9CClinton said gay marriage =E2=80=9Cis hardly a problem that is swee
ping the country=E2=80=9D because no state had legalized it. Republicans, he
 said, had brought it up as =E2=80=9Cone more attempt to divert the American
 people from the urgent need to confront our challenges together.=E2=80=9D=E2
=80=9D Barbara Vobejda, Clinton Defends Record on Gay Rights, Opposition to S
ame-Sex Marriage, The Washington Post, May 24, 1996

=E2=80=9CI have also said I have no intention of being a party to letting th
is legislation moving through Congress become an excuse for diverting and di
viding the American people and getting into a round of gay-bashing. I am bit
terly opposed to that. I will not participate in it.=E2=80=9D Remarks by Pre
sident Clinton from the Rose Garden, June 7, 1996

=E2=80=9C=E2=80=A6gay baiting, pure and simple.=E2=80=9D Mike McCurry, White
 House Press Secretary, July 12, 1996.

DOMA passed both houses of Congress by wide, veto-proof margins

 (there were only 14 =E2=80=9CNo=E2=80=9D votes in the entire Senate).

Even in signing the legislation, President Clinton issued a warning.

 =E2=80=9CI also want to make clear to all that the enactment of this legisl
ation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surround
ing it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination, violence or i
ntimidation against any person on the basis of sexual orientation. Discrimin
ation, violence and intimidation for that reason, as well as others, violate
 the principle of equal protection under the law and have no place in Americ
an society.=E2=80=9DStatement by President Bill Clinton, September 20, 1996

In 2009, Clinton called for the repeal of DOMA, specifically endorsed

repeal legislation, and announced his support of full marriage equality.

=E2=80=9CThroughout my life I have opposed discrimination of any kind," Clin
ton said in the statement. "When the Defense of Marriage Act was passed, gay
 couples could not marry anywhere in the United States or the world for that
 matter. Thirteen years later, the fabric of our country has changed, and so
 should this policy.=E2=80=9D Kerry Eleveld, Respect for Marriage Act Debuts
,domain.com, September 15, 2015 

=E2=80=9CSo I said, you know, I realized that I was over 60 years old, I gre
w up at a different time, and I was hung up about the word. I had all these g
ay friends, I had all these gay couple friends, and I was hung up about it. A
nd I decided I was wrong=E2=80=A6. I had an untenable position. =E2=80=9D Pr
esident Clinton to Anderson Cooper, domain.com, September 25, 2015
