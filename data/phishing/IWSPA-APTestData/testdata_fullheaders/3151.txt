Mr. user:

It has been another strong year for The Broad Superintendents Academy, and 
I'd like to share some of our recent successes with you...

 *   So far, 82% of our 2015 graduates have been hired by urban public scho
ol districts.

*         27% of our 2015 participants have already been hired by urban pub
lic school districts - four weeks before they've even finished the training
 program.

 *   80% of Broad Superintendent Academy graduates who served as superinten
dents for four years improved student achievement faster than other distric
ts in their states.

 *   In Delaware, one of only two states to win coveted Race to the Top<htt
p://domain.com/news/pressreleases/2010/03/03292010.html> funding, Academy 
graduates lead both the state Department of Education (Secretary of Educati
on Lillian Lowery) and the largest district in the state (Christina School 
District Superintendent Marcia Lyles).

As you may know, the Academy is the only program in the country that recrui
ts, trains, and supports superintendent candidates with corporate and non-p
domain.com executive management experience.  Academy participants attend several
 extended weekend sessions over a 10-month period while continuing full tim
e work in their current jobs, and then receive placement assistance and ext
ensive support in their new roles.  Tuition and travel costs are covered.

To recommend a colleague or express personal interest, please contact me by
 August 6, 2010.  The first step in our application process is submission o
f a professional resume, and the deadline for that is August 13, 2010.  For
 more information, you may also domain.com us at domain.com<<<link>>
