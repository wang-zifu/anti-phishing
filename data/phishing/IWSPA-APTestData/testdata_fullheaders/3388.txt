This is not a new idea, I have been thinking about this for months and waiti
ng for
the right moment.

HRC campaign should organize an in-person live endorsement of HRC by
Jack Nicholson.  Produce a video endorsement, which Nicholson did in 2008,
with a theme "she's the real deal".  Run the video one time as a paid televi
sion
ad on day two. Then put the video on her Facebook page.  Then email or text
the video to small donors and potential donors for a "fight back" fundraisin
g appeal.

Use text such as "I was raised by women, and I like the idea of America elec
ting the
first woman president, so long as it's the right person.  I've known Hillary
 Clinton
for X years, and she is the right person.  I know you hear a lot of stuff co
ming from
the other guys, but don't believe it.  I think Donald Trump was right when h
e said
Hillary was magnificent first lady and senator.  I think Carly Fiorina was r
ight when
she said in 2015 that she would have supported Hillary over any other candid
ate if
her friend John McCain wasn't running.  And Senator McCain was right when he
 said
Hillary was an outstanding Secretary of State.

So don't believe these other guys when they call her names.  Hillary Clinton
 is the
real deal. They can't handle the truth, and I know the truth because  I've k
nown Hillary Clinton for X years, and while she is fighting for us, we have t
o fight for her.  I hope you'll join me."

You get the idea.  There are other ways to text this.  Jack Nicholson has a h
istory of
supporting HRC.  He embodies a tough authenticity and genuineness.  He did a

good video for her in 2008.  He is the ideal guy to appeal to men and women a
nd
make "the real deal" argument in ways that aren't boilerplate politics and c
hampion
the "she fights for us" and "fight back" themes in 60 seconds.   And might m
entioning
Trump giving her such high praise it would attract even more huge attention a
nd put
the GOP slanders today in the context of the truth.

For the right message, Jack Nicholson is the perfect messenger.
