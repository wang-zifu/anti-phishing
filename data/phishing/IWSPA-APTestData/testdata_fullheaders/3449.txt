Petitioning China Film For a New Date for TASM2

Hi Michael,




In addition to Jeff’s team requesting a new date from China Film, we could augment the ask with a request from the MPA/Sen. Dodd to the head of SAPPRFT (regulator) to ask China Film to move the date.  That said, this isn’t exactly a formal process that the MPA has established and the MPA has not secured assurances of favorable outcomes with petitions of this kind. 




At issue, is the extent to which the MPA’s involvement might make our concern publicly known versus our ability to work on this discretely with China Film directly… 




I hope this info is helpful.  Please let me know if you need more info.
