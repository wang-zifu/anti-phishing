John --

Today is Election Day.

The opportunity to set our country on a new path has never felt more real 
than it does right now.

The polls are open in most places, and people are already making their 
voices heard for change.

There's just one thing left to do -- vote and make sure everyone you know 
votes, too.

You can find or verify your polling location by looking up your most 
recent registration address at domain.com:

<<link>>

Go vote today, and make sure you take your friends and family with you.

This is the day when we have to domain.com to doing everything we can. We 
can't afford not to -- for our families, our communities, and our future.

Once you vote, you can do more than just domain.com as the returns come in.

You can help get every last vote for Barack by volunteering in your 
community or making calls from home. Help put us over the top today:

It's not too late to knock on doors, make calls, and make sure that every 
one of our supporters gets to the polls today.

Change is within our reach. We're counting on you to get us there today.

Thank you for everything you're doing,

Michelle
