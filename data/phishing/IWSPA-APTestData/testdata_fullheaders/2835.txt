That's too bad -- is earlier possible tomorrow? Leah and I are each basically available through the afternoon.

All—




I can now rule out today, Wednesday, for this call.  




6 pm EST tomorrow, Thursday works for Mark and also I think works for Leah (please correct me if I am wrong, Leah).  So, is that good for Nicole?




Thanks,




Bruce

Mark, Nicole & Leah,




Please let me know your windows of availability this Thursday to discuss strategy for handling the Nadia Guo situation.  The anticipated interview of Ms. Guo is next Tuesday, to be preceded by an interview of Li Chow next Monday.
