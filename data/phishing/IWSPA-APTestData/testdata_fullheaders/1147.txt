Spent an hour with Bruce yesterday.  He's doing well; lots of therapy;
he and Halle will head to Little Rock just before Thanksgiving.

We went over a number of items we discussed in our Monday meeting.
Here are a few follow up items in no order of priority:
1) we discussed Bloomberg funding--I'll follow up with Patty Harris
2) he thinks he executed the Streisand grant agreement--I'll check in
with Margie Tabankin
3) discussed Pritzker cgi america funding Valerie should follow up
with JB and secure the commitment.
4) DLC--he thinks Tisdale is reviewing any filings including 990's
that need to be made.  Andy, will you follow up with John?
5) he's copasetic on Water St real estate.
6) thought he could participate in cgi post-Thanksgiving follow up
meeting by phone.
7) decision about possible Addis trip in December needs to be made. He
thought going could affect timing of contribution to some extent, but
will not secure the $ this year. I think he generally supports going,
but up to the President
8) He thinks he's signed off on salary bands/structures. Terry, do you
need anything else?
9) Suggests holding on any doc review at the archives until he returns
to Little Rock. Two exceptions--White House requests he can handle by
email; if any other emergency request comes up, I can process. I'm
holding a TS clearance.  Scott, you may need to figure out what we
need to do to add me to the review authority.  Hopefully, this won't
be an issue and can just slide till he gets back there.
10) Suggests I take his place on Haiti investment decisions. Laura,
can you let Jean-Marc know. I am going to be in China next week, so if
early decisions/calls need to be set up, might be tricky.  I'm back
next Friday afternoon.
Anything else you guys have hanging?
