hi CDM and Huma --

I don't want to get out in front of anything folks are thinking about, but
I'd certainly urge everyone to check in with Lorena about Hispanic
efforts.  She is the best in the business right now at reaching both
English-and Spanish-dominant latinos, and did a great job for Robby and his
team on behalf of Terry M in Virginia last year (the record # of Hispanic
votes that she got out in a Southern state in an off-year election -- I
think it was 63K -- was bigger than his margin of victory).  She's been
talking with Steyer's enviro fund, the DCCC, and Priorities about the next
cycle, but her heart is of course with Team Chappaqua.  And, she is the
only woman other than Mandy G to ever have done Presidential level
commercials.   I'd rave about her even if I wasn't married to her, but
since I am, it is even easier to vouch for her work!

I hope you are well

--LOU
