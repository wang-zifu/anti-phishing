Dejuana,

I felt that you made your point several emails ago, and could have done so more articulately in your first email.

If you would have dropped me a note to the effect of -- Deshundra, Virgie asked me about an op-ed and a radio interview. I was unaware of these requests. Would you please keep me in the loop? -- that would have served you better than asking if you missed some correspondence from my desk. 



I am out today but we should talk on Monday as it looks like we need to set some ground rules moving forward.
