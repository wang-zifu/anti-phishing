Hey April, I heard Jose Aristimuno might be getting considered for something for the week of convention. He's at HHS now so I assume it would be a short term thing, but wanted to give you a heads up that I've heard negative feedback about his performance and interpersonal skills coming off O'Malley's campaign, would recommend against it.

Hope you're well, -User.
