Michael-

I couldn't believe the news last week that General Motors was paying the new female CEO less than half of what they paid the man she replaced.

We hear about the gender pay gap in this country all the time, but it isn't often that we see such a blatant example of this kind of discrimination.

I hope you’ll join the women of Appel Women for Change in demanding action from Congress to address the pay gap that was so blatantly illuminated last week. Click here to add your name and demand action now!

If we are going to make a change, we have to call out discrimination when we see it. Thanks for joining us in doing that today!

Sincerely,
Ben Miller
Campaign Manager, Appel for Iowa

Ben-

Just a couple weeks ago, we celebrated the anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, but this news from one of America’s largest and oldest corporations show us that we still have a long way to go.

The news that General Motors hired the first woman to be CEO of any of the Big Three automakers is historic- but did you also hear this? They decided to pay her half of what her male predecessor made!

We can’t let this slide. Join me in telling GM and the big corporations who pay women less that you are ready to fight back – click here to demand an end to the pay gap!

The president called the ongoing pay gap “an embarrassment” in his State of the Union and I couldn’t agree more – because he’s right: “when women succeed, America succeeds."
