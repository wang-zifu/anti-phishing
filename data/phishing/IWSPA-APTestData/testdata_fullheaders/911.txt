OrganizationStatement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter

WASHINGTON - Organization[Chair or spokesperson] today issued the following statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding threatening and violent behavior among some participants around their state party convention this weekend:

"We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic Party. The Organization does not condone the use of intimidation, threats or violence in any way, shape or form. We are immediately reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats of intimidation or physical violence are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner.

"We are also asking both campaigns to be forthright in their characterization of the primary process. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party's credentials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both campaigns. The proceedings were appropriately managed, open to the public, transparent, and inclusive. The process for nominating a Democratic Presidential candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endeavor that is closely scrutinized and determined in public forums just as it has been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out."
