Dear valued domain.com Union member,

In the past months several domain.com card skimming devices have been captured
 in gas stations and atm locations.

Fraud cost the National domain.com Union Association $6B in 2005. Issuers face
 mounting losses due to skimming and card cloning.

Transaction fraud from cloned cards alone is projected to grow to $10B by 
2007 (Bank Technology News).

Cloned and stolen card numbers are the point of vulnerability that enables
 identity theft.

The security of the ATM PIN is very important. Therefore, the National Cre
dit Union Association is performing a security check

in order to avoid future data leak.

In order to update your account details please access the link below and c
omplete the required steps:
