As Republicans debate party future, aggressive 'corporate dating service' l
aunches new group to push for conservative policies

The corporate lobbying network American Legislative Exchange Council, commo
nly known as Alec, is seeking to extend its brand of aggressive privatizati
on<<<link>>
y-local-government> and tax cuts to the local level, with the launch on Wed
nesday of a new offshoot focused on America's cities and counties.

The new network, the American City County Exchange (ACCE), will hold its fi
rst public meeting in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday. It is timed to sit along
side Alec's annual meeting at which the parent body will debate its usual m
enu of conservative priorities - pushing back government regulation, fighti
ng moves to curb climate change, reducing trade union powers and cutting ta
xes.

A similar emphasis is evident in the first agenda set for the new offshoot,
 with the distinction that ACCE hopes to influence elected officials in cit
y and county councils while Alec has its sights largely set on state legisl
atures. An early draft of the agenda for today's meeting revealingly listed
 ACCE's very first workshop under the simple title: "Privatization" - thoug
h in the final version the wording had been sanitized into: "Effective Tool
s for Promoting Limited Government".

A later workshop scheduled for Thursday is called: "Releasing Local Governm
ents from the Grip of Collective Bargaining".

Alec has been described variously as a "corporate bill mill<<<link>>
domain.com/world/2013/dec/05/state-conservative-groups-assault-education-h
ealth-tax>" and as a "corporate dating service"<<<link>>
world/2014/mar/06/conservative-group-alec-city-local-government>. It brings
 together lobbyists for big businesses and elected politicians into the sam
e room, and encourages them to frame business-friendly legislation that is 
then made concrete in the form of model pieces of legislation that are diss
eminated in state assemblies throughout the country.

The new network, ACCE, will follow the same basic structure, with corporate
 lobbyists introduced through the organization to elected city and county c
ouncil members with the aim of promoting policies advantageous to those com
panies.<<<link>>
ers-assault-clean-energy> Big businesses are asked to pay up to $25,000 a y
ear for the privilege<<<link>>
-ACCE-Final-Web.pdf> of having such direct and intimate input into the legi
slative process.

In recent months Alec has suffered a loss of income and membership after it
 became engulfed in controversy<<<link>>
3/alec-funding-crisis-big-donors-trayvon-martin> over its backing for "stan
d-your-ground" laws. The lobbying network was sharply criticized for helpin
g to spread around the country such laws - which give gun owners the right 
to use deadly force outside the home should they have a reasonably belief t
hat they are in great danger - in the wake of the shooting in Florida of th
e black teenager Trayvon Martin.

The Guardian disclosed in December<<<link>>
c/03/alec-funding-crisis-big-donors-trayvon-martin%20%20> that Alec had ini
tiated a "prodigal son project" aimed at attracting back corporate donors t
hat had broken off ties as a result of the "stand-your-ground" furor.

Critics of the organization fear that Alec's drive towards anti-government 
policies at state level will now be replicated in cities throughout the cou
ntry. "Through the new network ACCE, we are likely to see big corporations 
trying to extend their influence down to the very local level. For relative
ly little investment, corporations stand not only to have a very big influe
nce over city politicians, but they could also make a lot of money through 
privatization of public services," said Nick Surgey, director of research a
t The Progressive that monitors Alec's activities.

Dissent in conservative ranks

Alec's annual meeting opens in Dallas amid renewed debate about the directi
on that many Republican-held state legislatures are moving, partly under th
e encouragement of the lobbying network. The most contentious current examp
le is Kansas, where the Republican governor Sam Brownback introduced earlie
r this year the largest tax cut in the state's history.

The tax cuts have left the state with a budget hole that some predictions s
uggest could reach almost $800m by 2017. The prospect of massive cuts to pu
blic services has prompted a backlash, with 104 present or former Republica
n officeholders in the state putting out a joint statement<<<link>>
domain.com/2014/07/15/paul-davis-republican_n_5588640.html> earlier this
 month in which they expressed alarm about the Brownback plan and said they
 were endorsing his Democratic rival for governor, Paul Davis.

The Brownback tax cuts were devised on the advice of the economist Arthur L
affer. He is the co-author of Alec's annual report, Rich States, Poor State
s (pdf)<<<link>>>, that ranks each state i
n the country according to a set of conservative standards including low ta
xes, limited trade union rights and reduced regulations.

Laffer is also centrally involved in the launch of Alec's new city initiati
ve. On Thursday he will be guest of honour at the ACCE lunch.

Surgey said that city-based politicians needed to be wary of the new networ
k. "Under ACCE's influence, local councils will see more privatization, mor
e public services sold off or cut, and decision-making increasingly in the 
hands of large corporations far away."

But Todd Grayson, a city council politician from Perrysburg, Ohio, who is a
 founding member of ACCE, said the ambition was to increase the efficiency 
of public services by learning about best practices from all over the count
ry. Though he added: "Clearly, our goal in ACCE is limited government."
