						Dear Amy,



						Deborah’s story is nothing short of a modern day miracle. In just a few short minutes you will see what it looks like to be truly and fully restored by the hand of God; from addiction to victory, from hunger to hope.



						As you will see, Deborah’s life was not only changed … it was saved. That, my friend, is what happens when you invest your time, your prayers, and your gifts into the ministry of the Los Angeles Mission. Today I’m inviting you to do just that. Please, give a gift so other hurting individuals like Deborah can find care and restored lives. Just $2.03 provides a hot meal, a clean bed and hope to one person who needs it. 



						It worked for Deborah, and I guarantee it will work again and again. So on behalf of the lives you are touching at the Los Angeles Mission’s Ann Douglas Center for Women, we want to say, “Thank you.”



						Herb Smith
						President & CEO 



						P.S. – Please join us on Facebook and Twitter for our latest updates at the Los Angeles Mission. And check out Ziggedy, a great way to provide meals and care at no cost to you.
