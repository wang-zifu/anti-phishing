Dear Friend,

It's one of those things we think a lot about, but rarely
discuss out loud.

I'm talking about legacy.

In Virginia, we are proud of the fact that we have a long
legacy of Governors who have put Virginia first -- who've
worked hard to make Virginia the best managed state, the
best state for business, and the best state to raise a
child. And I'm proud to be part of that legacy.

I'm writing to tell you this: Terry McAuliffe is the only
person in this race who will protect that legacy and build
upon what you and I have accomplished.

But he won't get that chance if he's outspent by his
opponent -- and he needs to raise another $53,580 before his
crucial end of quarter fundraising deadline tomorrow.

Please join me in supporting our next great governor, Terry
McAuliffe. Donate $5 to his campaign right now:

I've experienced some deja vu as I've followed this
election.

Because suddenly, there's another candidate with a magical
tax plan -- Terry's opponent is promising enormous tax cuts
with no idea or explanation for how he's going to pay for
them.

I had to clean up the mess that resulted from those kinds of
promises once, so I know going down that road again could
wipe away all the progress we've built together.

Fortunately, we can avoid that. With your help we can elect
a Governor who will be straight with us about the challenges
we're facing and work hard to get it right from the start.

Stand up for the legacy of the work we've done together.
Donate $5 to support Terry's campaign:

I promise you -- if you do your part, there's no one who
will work harder for all of us than Terry McAuliffe.

Thanks for standing with Terry -- and with me.

Sincerely,
Mark Warner
