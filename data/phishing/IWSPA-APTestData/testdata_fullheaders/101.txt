Follow-Up From Thriving in a Hotter L.A.: Turning Los Angeles into a Global Model for Urban Sustainability | April 22, 2015 Event

 <<link>>       

Greetings Members and Friends!




Women & Philanthropy is pleased to share that our most recent event, Thriving in a Hotter L.A.: Turning Los Angeles into a Global Model for Urban Sustainability, a collaboration with UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability (IoES), was a great success! 




Thank you for your participation on April 22nd if you were able to join us at our spring event!  We truly hope that you and your guests enjoyed what our panelists had to share about the exciting new campus-wide, interdisciplinary Grand Challenges initiative, whose goal is for the Los Angeles region to use exclusively renewable energy and local water by 2015 while protecting native biodiversity and enhancing our quality of life.




For those who were unable to attend, we thank you for your interest and are very sorry to have missed you.  We do hope that you will be able to join us for future events!




A video of the panel presentation can be found on our new YouTube channel at <<link>>  Please click on the link or copy and paste it into your browser.  Feel free to share the link with others who might want to view this special program.  In addition, attached are some materials from both departments for your reference.




Below is a special message from IoES Director, Mark Gold:




Thank you so much for spending your Earth Day with four extraordinary UCLA environmental professors and leaders.  All four women are critical members of UCLA's Grand Challenge team.  We are all so excited to be working on research and education that will make such an enormous, beneficial difference to the Los Angeles region.  If you are interested in the Grand Challenge and the work of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, please let me know at user@domain.com 




On behalf of both programs, we hope that you enjoyed this panel discussion.  This partnership is one of several in our extraordinary 20th year of the Women & Philanthropy program.  We look forward to being able to introduce you to many more exciting areas of UCLA in the months ahead.  Thank you, again, for your involvement with UCLA and of course, the Women & Philanthropy program!
