Karen,

I'm a published author and a story analyst who has lectured at the American Institute. My story analyst experience includes 5 years on staff at Paramount Pictures, and freelancing for many top production companies.

I was hired by Universal Pictures last year to cover screenplays for the Emerging Writers Fellowship Program.  As it turns out, two writers I recommended (MARGARET ROSE LESTER and IVY MARIEL PRUSS) have been selected by the studio as fellows.  There are only five fellows, and two of the five were recommended by me.

In my coverage of Margaret Rose Lester's screenplay, STREET VALUE, I wrote:  "The story line is tight and clean, consistently building in momentum with powerful set pieces.  Characterizations and dialogue are generally executed with aplomb, ultimately pointing to the fact that Margaret Rose Lester is a viable contender for the fellowship."

In my coverage of Ivy Mariel Pruss' screenplay, LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS, I wrote:  "The writing is generally so real that it feels like you're observing actual people, not characters."  I concluded with: "The writer needs some guidance and development, but exhibits enough skill and passion to be a viable candidate for the fellowship."

I'm a smart, savvy story analyst who could be of value to Sony Pictures, and Screen Gems executive Eric Paquette endorses my work.

If there aren't any openings for a story analyst, please include me on your fill-in list.

I have attached my coverage of the above-mentioned screenplays along with my resume. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Best,

Linda Stuart
