Before we move forward on Vilasck, we have to do our politics right.
The AG, Tom Miller, and the Treasurer, Mike Fitzgerald, were early and fervent supporters, while vilsack campaigned rather heavy-handedly for HRC.  They will be unhappy and it probably behooves the PE to call them before they learn this from the media to tell them we still love them.
