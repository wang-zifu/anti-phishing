Transcript

*STEVE KORNACKI: *and joining me now from burlington, vermont, Jeff Weaver,
the campaign manager for bernie sanders. Jeff, thanks for taking a few
minutes. you heard hillary clinton there saying, look, by far the most
expensive item on bernie sanders's agenda would be a single payer health
care republican and not put a specific plan forward with a price tag and
how he'll pay for it. what do you say to that?

*JEFF WEAVER: *well, as she said, secretary said, do it by the iowa
caucuses and i don't think they've come and gone yet. it's a strawman to
say --

*STEVE KORNACKI: *there's been reports, though, you might be reconsidering
that self imposed deadline. can you say affirmatively this is released? the
price tag and --

*JEFF WEAVER: *absolutely.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *how it's paid for before iowa.

*JEFF WEAVER: *100%. absolutely. 100%, steve. look. this is the real
argument here. the question is, are w a country going to guarantee health
care to all people? this has been a goal of democrats and democratic party
since franklin delanor roosevelt, lynndon baynes johnson and she's
abandoned the support of universal health care. you will remember the 2015 
press conference where secretary clinton rather viciously attacked
then-senator obama saying democrats should not attack each other on
universal health care and undermines democratic values and gives aid to the
special interests and allies in the republican party trying to stop
universal health care an that's what secretary clinton said in 2008.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *as well, a television ad you launched i think yesterday
in iowa and new hampshire.

*JEFF WEAVER: *sure, yep.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *i think you can say it's a contrast ad talking about wall
street, two democratic visions, does not name hillary clinton by name. but
look. it prompted some accuse yoscuriosity say saying bernie sanders said i
have never run a negative political ad in my life and people saying, look,
this is tame but this is getting close to that line. are you guys
reconsidering that pledge?

*JEFF WEAVER:* no, absolutely not. this is not a negative ad. let's be
clear. there's a wall street wing of the democratic party and that wall
street wing -- excuse me, has done great harm to the party. what bernie
sanders is trying to do is expand the base of the democratic party to bring
in a working people and young people, energize the party, to make it once
again the party that stands with middle class and working class people.
now, there are two visions. and most democrats actually share i think
senator sanders' vision. that's the truth.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *the ad, though, there's a wall street wing of the
democratic party, you're saying there's two visions, saying hillary
clinton's part of the wall street wing.

*JEFF WEAVER: *no. i didn't place her there. apparently her campaign feels
indicted by that.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *finally, i did want to play this. clair mccaskill
pointing out the fact that bernie sanders has been in the u.s. senate now
basically close to a decade. worked with all these democratic senators for
years saying, look, none of them come out to endorse him. here's what she
said.

*CLAIRE MCCASKILL (CLIP): *we have worked with these two people for years.
we know these two people andhow they work and whether or not they have the
strength and the skills necessary to lead a very divided country. we -- and
bernie sanders does not have one endorsement of one senator. now, that
should speak volumes  to people making up their mind.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *it is striking thinking of it, barack obama running
against hillary clinton in 2008. he certainly had some support from elected
officials from the colleagues in the senate, from top lead earls in the
party. not all but some and bernie sanders really has very little support,
basically none from the colleagues in the senate.

*JEFF WEAVER: *look. we knew starting the campaign bernie sanders not the
candidate of the establishment. the question is, what are the grassroots of
the democratic party think, the people who really make up the democratic
party think? i think what you are seeing in the polls, in fact, those
people coming to bernie sanders. i will also point out to you, steve, that
just yesterday senator -- former u.s. senator paul kirk, former head of the
dnc, came out and endorsed bernie sanders because he said it's imperative
to address the issue of the corrupt political system and supporting bernie
sanders. and as to the issue of electability, what the polls showing us,
steve, not conjecture and showing us that in head to head matchups of
republicans, bernie sanders does better against those republicans than does
secretary clinton. for a few reasons and one very important reason is that
he is extremely strong with independents. if democrats are going to keep
the white house, if they're going to take back the senate, win in state
legislatures across the country, they have -- t democratic party has to
have the support of independents. bernie sanders brings the support to
democrats. up and down the ballot. not just to himself and how he's going
to win in november. how democrats are going to win. he is the strongest
candidate against the republicans.

*STEVE KORNACKI: *all right. Jeff Weaver from the bernie sanders campaign,
thank you for your time this afternoon.
