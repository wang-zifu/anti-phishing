Dear Friends:

As you know, congressional attacks are intensifying against
the EPA's authority to regulate pollution and protect public
health and the
environment. Today's update provides information on the latest
efforts that anti-environment
legislators in the U.S. House and Senate are taking to cripple the
EPA, and
what you, as an environmentally-concerned citizen, can do to stop
these
damaging measures.

The Congressional
Attacks Continue
As you read this, the Senate is expected to consider harmful
proposals this week that would block the EPA from setting commonsense
limits on
global warming pollution as mandated under the Clean Air Act.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senator
Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) have both introduced amendments that would
block EPA's
ability to domain.com harmful carbon pollution, while Senator Max Baucus
(D-MT) has also
introduced an amendment that would interfere with the EPA's
steps to reduce
carbon pollution. =A0With the House having
already passed fiercely anti-environmental legislation, we cannot
allow
pro-polluter allies in the Senate to score a victory.

We Need Your Help!
These
damaging Senate measures will likely be voted on any day, and could
well come
down to just a few votes. LCV has identified a crucial group of five
swing
senators whose votes are essential to defeating these
anti-environmental
proposals-and who are currently undecided. =A0As a member of
LCV's Environmental Majority
Council, I am asking for your help in urging Senators Sherrod Brown
(D-OH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow
(D-MI), and Jon Tester (D-MT) to oppose any legislation that blocks,
weakens, or delays the EPA's ability to curb global warming
pollution.=A0 These senators need to hear from concerned
citizens that these issues are important to them; will you use your
voice to
send a clear and important message today?

You
can contact these senators' Washington, D.C. offices at:

Senator Sherrod Brown: (202) 224-2315
Senator Bob Casey: (202) 224-6324
Senator Amy Klobuchar: (202) 224-3244
Senator Debbie Stabenow: (202) 224-4822
Senator Jon Tester: (202) 224-2644

If
you have any questions on these issues or the senators'
positions, please
contact a member of our legislative team, either Tiernan Sittenfeld at
user@domain.com or
(202) 454-4582, or Sara Chieffo at user@domain.com
or (202) 454-4581.

New
Polling Shows Strong Support in Midwest for the EPA
Yesterday, LCV released new public opinion research showing that
two-thirds of voters in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania strongly
oppose
measures such as those being taken up in the House and Senate that
threaten the
EPA's authority to regulate pollution and, in so doing, impede
its ability to
protect public health and the environment.

You can read LCV's press release on the polling, along with
the top-line findings, here.

EPA Proposes First-Ever National Standards for
Mercury and Other Toxic Pollution Emissions
Despite these ongoing legislative attacks, the EPA has
continued to move forward to protect the environment and public
health. Most
recently, the EPA proposed the first-ever national standards for
mercury,
arsenic, lead, dioxins, acid gas, and six dozen other harmful
pollutants emitted
by power plants.

These
proposed rules-which are 20 years in the making-would save
as many as 17,000
American lives annually and will prevent up to 120,000 cases of
childhood
asthma and up to 11,000 cases of acute bronchitis in children.
=A0LCV is doing all we can to defend this ruling
from the already-fierce opposition being mounted by corporate
polluters and
their allies.

You can show your support for these life-saving air
pollution rules by
