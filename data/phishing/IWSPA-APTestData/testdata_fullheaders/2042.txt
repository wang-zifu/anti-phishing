Well but I thought this was consistent with our conversation.

From what Mark tells me about the call he had with you, I'm surprised becau
se I didn't hear that when we spoke. There's no way we're going to get our 
state parties to praise Ryan, that's a losing proposition because it would 
hurt them down ballot. They can't give down ballot candidates an easy out s
o we need better clarity on what it is you're thinking because the idea tha
t we would prop up Paul Ryan as a model isn't going to work.
