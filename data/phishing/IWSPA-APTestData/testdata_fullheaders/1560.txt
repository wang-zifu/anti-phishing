Thank god you made me laugh about this.

I feel like we are just replacing one disfunction with another.  And I
am going to tell him that to no avail, but why not?  I think he needs
different leadership for his PO operation.

I called Victoria to re apportionment on things like IT, HR,
corespondence - which as we all know is fine b/c we have been doing it
but what we now also know is how imprefectly that accounting was being
done (e.g., correspondence reported to justin that very little if any
time was spent on non-foundation matters so they didn't need to turn
in any hours).

She said fine but said there always is domain.com risk that will show
inaccurate apportionment hence why most folks of privilge just prefer
to pay it themselves to avoid the risk.

sigh.

He's of course out despite an agreed time to speak at noon (and still
not back yet) so I know this will drag on until tonight.

cdm
