Dear Mr. Ammar,

thanks for your e-mail and call.



As per our calling, I’m here to confirm you a conference/skype call in the coming days. Alessandro that read us in c.c. will let us know the suitable time. This
 is the standard practice to meet your requirement about the upgrade and password issues.



Furthermore we would like to inform you that it’s a pleasure for us to domain.com you for many reason, not only for business, but also for your hospitality as well.
 I’m really sorry to not meet you and your team due the fact we spent a very good time together here in Milan, Rome and Florence and I was and I’m enthusiastic to meet you. For sure we will schedule a domain.com to you as soon as possible.



The reason why we will not have the opportunity to come is because, as said to you by phone when I was abroad, we have many activities already planned from time
 ago.



Appreciate your understanding and hope that you can accept our apology.



Warmest regards
