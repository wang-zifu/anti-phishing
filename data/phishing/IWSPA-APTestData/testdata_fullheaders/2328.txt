A request

Dear Amy,

I'm looking forward to meeting and catching up. 

Meanwhile, we (Coalition of Engaged Education, formerly New Visions Foundation), are doing our first-ever fundraiser "Poetic Justice," and I was hoping that SONY might take a sponsorship page (they range from $2,500 on up). Each sponsor's name will be on a separate page with a lovely quote from a poem. 

The sponsorship opportunities and the SAVE the DATE are attached.

See you soon,

Paul
