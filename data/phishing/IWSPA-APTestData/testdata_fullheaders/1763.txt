Electability - Hillary Rodham Clinton says she's the best candidate to 
win the presidency against Republicans. Speaking in Iowa yesterday, she 
argued she has more experience battling the GOP than any other candidate 
in the Democratic field, reports domain.com and Hispanidad in the Spanish 
language version of an AP article.

Iraq - Due to the fact that violence has decreased in Baghdad, the 
leading Democratic presidential candidates are adopting a new attitude 
towards Iraq: recognize that there has been some success in that regard, 
reports El Nuevo Herald in the Spanish language version of an AFP 
article. It mentions that the advisors of both Senator Clinton and Obama 
have agreed that security conditions have improved since more troops 
were shipped to Iraq. Yet, the article adds that, advances made in Iraq 
have not shifted the candidates' position - they are still committed to 
bringing the troops back home.

Immigration - Maribel Hastings writes a story on immigration published 
by both El Diario La Prensa (NY) and La Opinion (both outlets part of 
the Impremedia group), on how even though it's not a "priority issue" 
for voters, the issue has become one of the most dangerous political 
subjects for the presidential candidates. She mentions how some 
Republicans like Rudy Giuliani have changed their position, while others 
are just flat out anti-immigrant like Tom Tancredo, and how Democrats 
like Senator Clinton have been accused of shifting their positions.

Healthcare - Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said that in order for 
universal healthcare to work people are going to have to start 
approaching it in the same way they do with car insurance, reports La 
Opinion. It mentions that the idea of universal healthcare does well in 
the polls, and that Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and John 
Edwards are both driving as one of the central issues for their 
campaigns. The story mentions that Governor Schwarzenegger's plan is the 
most ambitious healthcare plan since HRC's in the 1990's.

Obama - El Diario La Prensa (NY) picks up a short note on Senator 
Obama's domain.com to New York this Thursday, for a fundraising event in the 
Apollo theatre in Harlem - "only block away from WJC's office", adds the 
story.
