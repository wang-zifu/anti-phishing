RE: Abortion and Health Care Reform

As a couple of media stories have noted that abortion may be the next
=93battle=94 in health care reform, we wanted to highlight a handful of goo
d
articles that separate out the myths from the facts.

Anti-health care reform critics are using misinformation about abortion to
try and undermine health care reform. But, a number of independent media
sources, including Washington Post, PolitiFact, NPR, LA Times, and Boston
Globe, have =93factchecked=94 and rebutted these misleading attacks.

*Washington Post: The Next Health Reform Myth*
By Ruth Marcus
<<link>>
2960.html

=93You're going to be hearing more of the same. Don't believe it. These
inflammatory statements do a disservice to a complex issue of public policy
:
how, in the context of health reform, to balance the deeply felt views of
both sides in the abortion debate=85.
In the House, an amendment offered by Rep. Lois Capps (D-Calif.) nicely
threads these narrow-eyed needles.

With respect to private insurance, the Capps amendment makes clear that
companies participating in the exchange cannot be required to include
abortion coverage and that plans cannot -- contrary to Boehner's assertion
-- discriminate against health providers that decline to provide abortions.

In addition, it requires that the exchanges include at least one plan
without abortion coverage -- relieving abortion opponents from worrying tha
t
their premiums would be used to pay for abortions -- and one that offers
coverage. Although private plans could include abortion coverage, they coul
d
not use federal funds for that purpose. Instead, plans that choose to
include this coverage could set aside a portion of their private premiums
that could then be used to pay for abortion services.=94

*LA Times editorial: Healthcare reform bill doesn't cover elective abortion
s
*
<<link>>,0,7271055.story

=93Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe vs. Wade, every federal health
insurance program has become enmeshed in the debate over federal funding fo
r
abortion. This year's efforts to reform the healthcare system have triggere
d
a new tussle, with opponents of abortion claiming that the proposals would
change the long-standing policy against using federal tax dollars to
terminate pregnancies. But the provision that antiabortion groups find so
objectionable would actually have the opposite effect, forcing private
insurers to go further to fund and account for abortion coverage separately
from federally subsidized services=85.

The Capps amendment isn't a nefarious plan to promote abortions. It's a
reasonable compromise.=94

*Boston Globe: Latest myth on health reform*
<<link>>
1/latest_myth_on_health_reform/

=93Having successfully dispatched the fictional =91death panels=92 from the
 health
reform legislation making its way through Congress, conservative critics ar
e
aiming at another mythical target in the bill: =91abortion mandates.=92

Just as opponents twisted voluntary end-of-life discussions into government
mandates for euthanasia, so too are abortion services the subject of
confusion and disinformation=85.

Finding common ground on abortion is as elusive as ever, but the House bill
makes a good stab at it with a provision that every region in the country
must offer insurance plans that cover abortion and plans that don=92t. That
way, there is a choice for consumers who feel strongly about the issue=85.

No one wants to see the health care overhaul founder on a single issue. But
neither should women=92s reproductive health be compromised away in an effo
rt
to buy increasingly unlikely bipartisan support. The =91abortion mandate=92
crowd will not be satisfied until the health care system eliminates a safe,
legal, medical procedure that trusts women to make the right choices about
their own lives.=94

*Des Moines Register editorial: Don't let abortion debate derail reform*
August 11, 2015 
<<link>>
ORTS09

=93Mark Twain once said, =91Get your facts first, then you can distort them
 how
you please.=92

Anti-abortion-rights groups either don't have the facts about health-care
reform, or they're intentionally distorting them. They are opposing a
=91public option=92 for health insurance, saying it would cover abortions. 
The
Associated Press quoted Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National
Right to Life, as saying the public plan =91pays for abortion.=92

Wrong=85.

The truth is this: Many opponents of abortion rights won't accept anything
other than a total ban on the medical procedure in this country - even if i
t
means latching on to the health-care-reform legislation to draw attention t
o
their agenda.

The propaganda they're spreading doesn't jibe with the truth about how
health-care reform is being crafted in Washington.=94

*NPR: Abortion In The Health Care Bills: What's True?*
<<link>>

Mr. FARLEY (PolitiFact): Exactly. Studies have shown that somewhere between
45 and 80 percent of the women who have health care coverage through their
companies currently get abortion coverage. And so, the argument then is tha
t
if the government plan were to disallow that, you would essentially be
stripping that coverage from people who already - who currently get that.

MELISSA BLOCK (NPR): Well, when you put the statements that are being made
out there through your Truth-O-Meter, as you call it on domain.com,
where do you end up on this question of abortion and plans for heath
insurance overhaul?

Mr. FARLEY (PolitiFact): Well, we specifically looked at the question of
whether federal tax dollars will be used to subsidize abortions. And that
kind of language isn't in any of the versions of the plan that are kicking
around in Congress. And specifically, the House version, with the Capps
Amendment, states that no federal funds could be used to subsidize
abortions. And so we ruled that false.

*PolitiFact: FALSE: Boehner says Democrats' health care plan would subsidiz
e
abortions*
<<link>>
/boehner-says-democrats-health-care-plan-would-lead/

=93The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floati
ng
around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final pla
n
will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow
for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that woul
d
require taxpayers to foot the bill for that.

In fact, in a key version of the bill =97 the one passed by the House Energ
y
and Commerce Committee =97 members went to great pains to include an amendm
ent
to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again,
things could change as the health reform package works its way through
Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim tha
t
taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.=94

*PolitiFact: PANTS ON FIRE: School health clinics would not provide
abortions*
<<link>>
sel/school-health-clinics-would-not-provide-abortions/

=93The Liberty Counsel, a conservative group, puts a different twist on tha
t
concern, alleging that Page 992 of the bill =91will establish school-based
'health' clinics. Your children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildre
n
may be aborted!=92=85

We see no language in the three main versions of the bill that would allow
school-based clinics, which have a long history of providing basic health
services to underprivileged students, to provide abortions. Nor would the
clinics even be new =97 they have been around for three decades. So we rate
the claim Pants on Fire!=94

*domain.com: Surgery for Seniors vs. Abortions?*
<<link>>

=93In fact, none of the health care overhaul measures that have made it
through the committee level in Congress say that abortion will be covered,
and one of them explicitly says that no public funds will be used to financ
e
the procedure.=94

***

In addition, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards has an article on
Huffington Post responding to the misleading attacks, and PP=92s website ha
s a
good myth v. reality resource document.

*Huffington Post: Misleading Attacks on Women's Health*
By Cecile Richards
<<link>>
50093.html

The simple fact is that most women with private insurance in America alread
y
have access to full reproductive health care, and the vast majority of
employment-based health plans treat abortion coverage like the rest of
health care -- as a covered domain.com. Understandably, the vast majority of
Americans believe that women shouldn't be worse off as a result of health
care reform. In fact, a recent poll conducted by the Mellman Group on behal
f
of the National Women's Law Center found that American voters would oppose 
a
plan that does not include access to comprehensive reproductive health care
,
including abortion care -- because voters want health care decisions to be
made by medical experts, not by members of Congress, and certainly not by
the Family Research Council.
