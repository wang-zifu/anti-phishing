Good evening-
I wanted to flag a big issue with Terry O'Sullivan/LIUNA I ran into today.
On a NH rope line, HRC told a attendee that she opposes the controversial
NED pipeline.  HRC's comment on the ropeline was only half of the
answer...she has been referencing her concerns around FERC addressing local
concerns as a part of her potential opposition.  But now she is on the
record as just opposing another pipeline.

I have been told privately that Terry is considering pulling back on the
campaign and is cancelling his Las Vegas trip for our Presidents meeting
with John.  Terry has been to Iowa to rally members and was planning a big
canvass in Las Vegas on Saturday with members as well.  I would hate to
lose his engagement.

HRC is in Nevada on Saturday and Emmy wanted HRC stop by LIUNA's
canvass/rally.  I would like to request a 10 minute clutch with just HRC
and Terry to discuss energy and smooth some things out.  I think it will go
a long way and help reengage Terry.  He just needs assurances of her energy
policy proposal.  Emmy is on board with giving me the 10 minutes to do
this.  I wanted to flag for you for approval for her schedule.

If possible, I would like to make this offer to LIUNA tomorrow before
O'Sullivan cancels his trip.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions.
