I was talking with Eric Schmidt yesterday in our offices about our
Business Leaders Outreach program.  Shortly after our meeting he was
directed to Rouse and I about participating in the transition.  Our IT
guys who have working with him on various projects and at the same time
assisting Genachowski and Edley on the White House IT stuff and working
with Froman on using IT for hiring personnel.  They think that Schmidt
would be able to help on both of those projects.  Is it fine if I reach
out to Genachowski, Edley and Froman and gauge their interest in having
him help?  He has already done a lot for the campaign.
