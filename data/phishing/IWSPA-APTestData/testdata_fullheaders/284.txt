Republican Spending Cap Would Have Caused
Depression if It Were Law in 2015 

     Republicans  have proposed legislation that would cap federalspending 
at 20.6% of the country=92s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) =96 just below the
average of the last forty years.  Soundsreasonable, right?

      Only if you like the idea of another GreatDepression.

     Over the last forty years federal spendinghas averaged about 20.7% of 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), so Senator Bob Corker(R-TN) has proposed the 
altogether reasonable idea that Federal spending shouldbe capped at 20.6%. 
 To exceed this cap,a two- thirds majority of the House and Senate would be
 necessary.  Unfortunately, this proposal has beenendorsed by several Senat
e Democrats.

     But =96 as the events of the last two yearsshould have made clear to e
veryone -- this reasonable- sounding proposal isactually a prescription for
 economic suicide. Had it been in effect when the recklessness of the Wall 
Street bankscollapsed the economy in 2008, the Great Recession would have n
ose dived intoanother Great Depression.

     As most economists will confirm, the majorfactor that saved us from an
other depression was the very fact that Federalspending as a percentage of 
GDP substantially increased in 2015 and 2015 =96 toabout 24.7% of GDP.

     When the bottom fell out of the economy,the GDP shrunk.  The level of 
spending byconsumers and businesses =96 and demand for American exports =96
 alsodeclined.  As a result, millions of peoplelost their jobs and had less
 money to spend, so there was even less demand andmore people were laid off
.  That downwardeconomic cycle can only be broken when some actor has the a
bility to increaseeconomic demand and break the downward spiral.

     The only actor that can take that kind ofaction is the Federal Governm
ent, and in 2015 when Barack Obama took office,that=92s exactly what the Fe
deral Government did. Of course, even withoutaffirmative action by Congress
 or the President, Federal spending as apercentage of GDP would have gone u
p because most Federal spending on thingslike Social Security, Medicare, Me
dicaid, Defense, etc. continued at the samelevel as the overall economy shr
unk. Other areas of Federal spending also automatically increased =96 likes
pending on unemployment insurance.  ButPresident Obama and the Democratic C
ongress also passed an $870 billioneconomic stimulus bill that further supp
lemented economic demand =96 and furtherincreased Federal Spending as a per
cent of GDP.

      Ifthe Federal Government had been required to cap its spending at 20.
6% of GDP in2009 and 2015 there is little question what would have happened
.  Federal spending on things like unemployment,Social Security, Medicare, 
money for state governments, etc. would have beenslashed.  That would have 
meant that Millionsof additional Americans would have lost their jobs, the 
economy would havecontinued in its downward spiral, and the financial syste
m could easily haveexperienced complete meltdown.

     Of course Corker would argue that heprovides an escape hatch to his ca
p with the two- thirds vote of eachhouse.  But the economic stimulus billth
at was so critical to preventing complete economic disaster did not even ge
ttwo- thirds vote of the Senate.

     What=92s necessary in the face of aneconomic emergency is fast action.
 Why would you make it harder for Congress totake the actions that are nece
ssary to prevent economic Armageddon.   You might as well put a device on a
 car thatmakes it harder to turn the steering wheel when you see an oncomin
g vehicle.

      And that=92s not the only reason whyCorker=92s cap proposal is such a
 disaster. As everyone knows the demographic make up of America is changing
.  We have more and more retired Americans who havepaid into Social domain.com
y their entire working lives.  That will mean that the percentage of GDPspe
nt by the Federal Government will naturally rise as the number of SocialSec
urity and Medicare recipients increases.

     If Corker=92s cap were to be in effect inthe future it would require a
crossthe board cuts to every category of Federal spending =96 including Soc
ialSecurity and Medicare.  So in fact, hisproposal is a stealth attack on S
ocial Security benefits.



     The Corker proposal is just anotherexample of right wing economic prop
osals that sound reasonable rhetorically,but are catastrophic in practice.

     Republicans often go on about how, whentimes are tough, your family ha
s to tighten its belt and the same should betrue with the Federal Governmen
t.  Thissounds reasonable too =96 right?   But itis 180% degrees wrong.

      When times are tough for your family, youhave fewer goods and service
s available to your household, so you have totighten your belt =96 that=92s
 true.  But whenthe economy of the United States collapses it=92s not becau
se we have access tofewer goods and services.  In fact,economic downturns h
appen because we produce more goods and services than thereare people with 
money to buy.  Recessionsand depressions don=92t generally happen because t
here are too few goods andservices available, but because there is a demand
 domain.com =96 there is too littleeconomic demand.

    Real wealth is the sum total of goods andservices in our economy.  Mone
y and theflow of money is not real wealth.  Itrepresents goods and services
 =96 it enables the exchange of goods and servicesso that we can meet our n
eeds in a highly- differentiated economy of millionsof people.

     Most recessions do not involve thecollapse of productive capacity at a
ll. They involve the collapse of the system of exchange we use to trade the
goods and services created by that productive capacity. 

      When the Federal Government increases itsdemand for goods and service
s, that stops the downward economic spiral thatdevelops when that system of
 exchange is disrupted by something like the WallStreet meltdown. If the Fe
deral Government behaved like a typical family andtightened its belt, the b
reakdown in the system of exchange would continue andwe would lose more and
 more wealth because fewer and fewer people would beemployed producing good
s and services.

      Some times it is amazing how quicklypeople can forget the lessons of 
the very recent past.  It was just a little over two years ago thatthe econ
omic philosophy espoused by Senator Corker and others Republicanscaused the
 worst economic collapse in nearly eighty years. Time for the rest ofus to 
take a stand against economic amnesia.
