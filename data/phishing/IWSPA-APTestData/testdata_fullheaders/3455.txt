Would you please share this in the check-out meeting?

I am working on a response from a Reuters reporter re: data on provisional ballots in North Carolina. Also, working on a quote about the importance of the Native American vote in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.

I am also working on a statement for Wisconsin voter ID testimony.

Also working with my states on National Infrastructure Week.
