SAG Film Society Q&A Tonight

Good Evening,

We just concluded the SAG Q & A with David O. Russell and moderator Timothy Blake from SAG. 

The film played fantastically well and culminated in very enthusiastic applause. 

Timothy asked about the romance in the film and how David's early childhood influenced his outlook on working class people. That was his wake up call to his second chapter in filmmaking that embodies his recent trilogy of movies that culminates with this films themes of reinvention, survival etc. 

Timothy was very complimentary of all the performances, the music, costumes etc and regards David as the quintessential actor's Director. 

David complimented his cast and highlighted Christian as a 'transformational creature from another acting domain.com.'

They talked about his rehearsal process and how it continues throughout the shoot and new ideas can be born on the fly. 

David thanked the audience for coming out over the holidays and the 2nd screening which begins at 10:15pm already has a line. 

David was incredibly charming and hugely embraced by the guild. 

Thank you and almost happy new year!

Andre
