Oo La La: A First Look at Netflix in France 
Netflix launched in the UK in January 2015 and reported they had reached 1 million subscribers on August 20, 2012.  Just over two years later, we believe they have over three million subscribers
 in the UK (~26 mm households).
We were able to try the French version of Netflix’s service earlier today using our Android phone.  We shot a four-minute video (embedded
 first below) to give you a feel for the breadth and depth of content, including key US television and movie titles, as well as local French content.  There are clear differences from Netflix’s US service, such as no Mad Men or House of Cards, but
 the addition of titles unavailable in the US such as Modern Family and Homeland.  Netflix clearly had to deal with different content rights availability in France, domain.com, there are a significant number of high profile titles that work well in the US available
 in France (including Breaking Bad, Orange is the New Black, Walking Dead, etc.)
