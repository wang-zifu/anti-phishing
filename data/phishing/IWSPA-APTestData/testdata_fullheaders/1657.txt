Hello AMY,
You can use Backstage to find actors, singers, dancers, models, musicians, comedians, stunt performers, cabaret acts, mimes, clowns, variety performers, voiceover artists, triple-threats, students, teachers, staff, crew, and so much more.
Post a call for talent to get started. Need an extra boost? Try one of the premium posting upgrades below!

SPECIAL OFFER: 
For a limited time, you can receive 70% off by entering promo code SPECIAL2 when posting a listing.*

POSTING ENHANCEMENTS:

Featured Listing: This deluxe VIP option ensures that your posting is marked as an expanded and featured item in search results, while also bringing your listing ongoing exposure as it'll be automatically highlighted in the Featured Casting sidebar module, in rotation with other featured listings, thousands of times across various pages of the site.
Print Spotlight: Your listing will be included in Backstage's print-publication and digital-edition magazines and also appear as a special spotlight item in online search results. Click here to view a free sample copy of Backtage Magazine.
Extra Categories: You can choose a primary "production type" category as the first step when creating a job posting. Then, during the checkout process you can choose up to two additional categories, doubling or tripling the number of search results your listing appears in.Example: If you're seeking cast and crew for a movie that involves some dance scenes, choose Feature Films as your primary casting category, and then choose Dancers & Choreographers and Film & TV Crew as your secondary categories.




Please let us know how your search for talent turns out!
Luke Crowe VP, Casting domain.com/FindTalent



* This promo code will reduce the cost of your next posting by 70%, so you can find cast and crew for as little as $7.50! The code will expire in 10 days. The code cannot be used retroactively for notices that were already paid for. Backstage's Casting Editors retain the right to domain.com, rewrite, format, re-categorize, expire, or reject all postings. The special Posting Enhancements are completely optional for all casting calls and job listings except for Class/Workshop ad postings, which must choose Workshops as their primary category and must choose the Print Spotlight and/or Featured upgrades at minimum. All postings appear on domain.com instantly.
