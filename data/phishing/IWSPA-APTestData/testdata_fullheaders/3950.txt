        Dear valued Bank of America member,

        It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent
transactions are 
        caused by fraudsters using stolen account information to purchase
or sell 
        non existant items. Thus we require our members to enroll in our
SiteKey 
        security upgrade, as part of our continuing commitment to protect
your 
        account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. After
you

based 
        on your personal computer, allowing us to recognize you in any
future 
        online banking sessions and thus immediately spotting any
unauthorized 
        access. By passing back and forth secret information that only you
and 
        Bank Of America know, you can feel even more secure with
your online 
        banking experience. We recognize you and you recognize us. If you
could 
        please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and enroll
in the 
        SiteKey security upgrade, you will not run into any future problems

        We are requesting this information to verify and protect your

        Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, 
        and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or
obtaining 
        ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of
the U.S. 
        banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these
reasons, 
        Bank Of America will utilize services provided by various
domain.com 
        reporting agencies to verify the information you domain.com to us. 

        Once you have enrolled in our SiteKey security upgrade your pending
Bank 
        Of America account transactions will not be interrupted and
will continue 
        as normal. 

Please enroll in our SiteKey security upgrade by clicking 
        here. 

        Thank you for your time,

Regards,
