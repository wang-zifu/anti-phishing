John -- this is urgent:

As you read this, a right-wing outside group is running a massive ad 
campaign on Arizona T.V. smearing Ann's record.

With the primary just FIVE days away, it couldn't be more critical that we 
fight back for Ann -- right now.

That's why we're launching Ann Kirkpatrick's Grand Canyon Victory Project. 
Funded by grassroots supporters like you, this program will provide the 
critical resources we need to reach out to voters and help spread Ann's 
message.

So, chip in today, we'll mark you down as a Founding Member. But make sure 
you hurry, Ann's re-elections campaign is hanging in the balance!

contacting Arizona voters across our vast district and supporting critical 
volunteer efforts.

So don't domain.com -- chip in today to help us start off strong:
