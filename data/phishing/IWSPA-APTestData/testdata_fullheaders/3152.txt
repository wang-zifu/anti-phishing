The WriteGirl office is buzzing this afternoon as our teen girls are writing poems for our 3rd Annual Poetry Drive! It's a POETRYPALOOZA and the new LA Youth Poet Laureate, 16-year-old Amanda Gorman, is here, along with Youth Poet Laureate finalist Jessica, 15!   

Amanda Gorman, LA Youth Poet Laureate   




They are all hard at work creating literary masterpieces just for you! Whether you choose a poem with a surprise theme or get one customized for you, the possibilities are endless! This year, we are featuring a Girl Perspective poem, written BY a girl, FOR a girl. Give us your heroine’s name, her little quirks, or favorite pastime, and our girls will give her a female empowerment anthem!

Your contribution helps us launch our 14th season in October! We've had an incredible year – help keep us thriving as we enter our next season!

Season 13 Ends with a
Sparkling Soirée

 <<link>>        

Our big Season-End Celebration at the Writers Guild Theater capped off an amazing season! Poems were purchased, items were auctioned, Oscars-style selfies were taken, and of course, the season’s writing was celebrated. Mentees took to the stage and read bits of poetry and prose, as well as writing tips that have helped inspire them.
