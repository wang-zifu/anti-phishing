Lyin=92 Ted Cruz calls it quits

Austin, TX-- Cuban-American, Canadian-born, Ted Cruz ended his desperate ra
ce to the White House tonight. Despite being mathematically eliminated, Cru
z took extraordinary measures to attract attention =97 his efforts failed t
o persuade his own party to vote for him.

The Republican Party is now facing a stark truth: reality-TV star Donald Tr
ump will be their presidential nominee.

Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa issued the following stat
ement:

=93Cruz was beat by his own game. Inflammatory rhetoric, anti-immigrant pol
icies and dirty politics dominated the Republican Primary.

=93Like most of the Republican Party, Cruz has been obsessed with fringe is
sues and the politics of fear. But this time he met his bigoted match.

=93It's time for Republicans to get real comfortable with dangerous Donald 
Trump being the voice and face of their party. It's time for lyin=92 Ted Cr
uz to start preparing for his 2015 Republican primary for Senate.=94
