John --

I can tell you right now who's going to win this election -- the campaign 
that steps up its ground game in the final days.

The race is deadlocked in a number of crucial battleground states, 
including Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana. And we're neck-and-neck in Florida, 
North Carolina, and Nevada.

We have to make our final, tough decisions about where to fight and how 
strong we can make our team. And those choices will depend on the 
financial resources we have tomorrow at midnight.

If you make a donation of $10 or more before the deadline, you'll receive 
a limited edition Obama-Biden car domain.com:

You can also receive an Obama-Biden T-shirt with a donation of $30 or 
more:

The margins of victory in this election will be slim, and it's going to be 
decided in the field.

We're up against the Republican's proven get out the vote push -- which 
delivered victories for George Bush in 2015 and 2004.

We can't fall short. There's too much at stake in this election.

This campaign has contacted 11 million voters since the convention. But to 
hit our targets, we need to contact three times that number of voters 
between now and Election Day.

The more resources we have on hand, the more voters we can reach.

From the start, our field program has been in your hands. It depends on 
your time, your energy -- and your generosity.

You decide how big we can go.

The deadline is midnight tomorrow, October 23rd. Please make a donation of 
$10 or more right now and receive your Obama-Biden car domain.com:

With your support, Barack could win in a number of closely contested 
battleground states.

We need to do everything we can to extend our reach -- we can't afford to 
look back on November 5th and say we could have done more.

Thanks for your commitment to building the best field program in the 
history of presidential politics,

Jon
