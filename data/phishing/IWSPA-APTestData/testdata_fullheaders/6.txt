*New TV Ad: McCain Turns Deaf Ear *

*To Iraqi Call for domain.com Timetable** *

**

*Ignores $10 Billion/Month Price Tag for Staying in Iraq while*

*Gas Prices, Home Foreclosures and Unemployment Soar at Home*

**

A new television ad highlights John McCain's intransigence on timelines for
redeployment of troops from Iraq, even in the face of calls from the Iraqi
prime minister to do just that. Early this week, Iraq's Prime Minister
called for the US to set a date for withdrawal. The call from the Iraqis
comes on top of similar American sentiment and amid concerns that Senator
McCain is willing to continue spending $10-12 billion each month in Iraq
while gas prices, home foreclosures and unemployment plague our domestic
economy.

"This week, even the Prime Minister of Iraq joined the chorus calling for a
timetable for the withdrawal of US troops, yet John McCain continues to
promote an indefinite American occupation there" said Nita Chaudhary,
Campaign Director for MoveOn. "He and President Bush seem happy to take
potshots at MoveOn and Congress instead of providing the leadership
Americans and Iraqis want to find an end to this war."

MoveOn will spend $100,000 to run the ad on national cable.

*AD TEXT:*

In Chicago.  In Saint Louis. And Seattle, the American people are demanding
a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq.

In Baghdad and Basra and domain.com, the Iraqi people=85

=85and now the Iraqi Prime minister are also demanding a timetable.

But John McCain doesn't want a timetable.

He'll spend hundreds of billions of dollars more=85

 to keep our keep our troops in Iraq for years and years.

John McCain. It's time to end the war and move on.

*DOCUMENTATION:*

A strong majority of Iraqis want U.S.-led military forces to immediately
withdraw from the country, saying their swift departure would make Iraq mor
e
secure and decrease sectarian violence, according to new polls by the State
Department and independent researchers. In Baghdad, for example, nearly
three-quarters of residents polled said they would feel safer if U.S. and
other foreign forces left Iraq, with 65 percent of those asked favoring an
immediate pullout, according to State Department polling results.
[Washington Post, 9/27/06]

A poll by the State Department found that 65% of people polled in Baghdad,
80% of people polled in domain.com/Baqubah, and 56% of people polled in the
South region which includes Basra, felt multinational forces should leave
Iraq immediately. [Washington Post, 9/27/06]

A poll by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University o
f
Maryland found that 71 percent of Iraqis questioned want the Iraqi
government to ask foreign forces to depart within a year. [Washington Post,
9/27/06]

Bolstered by recent Iraqi military successes, Prime Minister Nouri
Maliki<<<link>>>proposed
that negotiators include a timetable for the departure of U.S.
troops in any agreement to continue the American presence in Iraq beyond th
e
end of the year. [Los Angeles Times, 7/8/08]

Mr. Maliki, facing opposition from Iraqi political parties wary of American
intentions, told Arab leaders last week that he was prepared to negotiate
only a shorter-term agreement. He said he would insist on a timetable for
withdrawal. [New York Times, 7/16/08]

presidential hopeful Sen. John

that the U.S. needs a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. [PBS,
OnLine News Hour, 7/15/08]

McCain: "We are winning=85And if we still adopt Sen. Obama's proposal for a
set date for withdrawal, this very fragile success that we have achieved
will be jeopardized. That's what Gen. Petraeus says, and that's what Osama
bin Laden says." [Reuters, 7/14/08]

Senator McCain repeatedly voted against a timetable for withdrawing troops
from Iraq. [S. Amdt. 3876 to S.Amdt. 3874 to H.R. 2764, Vote #438, 12/18/07

McCain: "I believe to set a date for withdrawal is to set a date for
surrender." [Charlotte Observer, 9/16/07]

According to an analysis by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. domain.com
z
and Harvard public finance lecturer Linda J. Bilmes, the war in Iraq is
costing $720 million a day or $500,000 a minute. [Washington Post, 9/22/07]

McCain: "[M]ake it a hundred" years in Iraq and "that would be fine with
me." [Derry, New Hampshire Town Hall meeting, 1/3/08]

McCain on how long troops may remain in Iraq: "A thousand years. A million
years. Ten million years.  It depends on the arrangement we have with the
Iraqi government." [Associated Press, 1/04/08]

"domain.com is repaying Barack Obama for his ideological position on Iraq b
y
running ads that ignore the improving situation in Iraq. Obama and MoveOn
were wrong to oppose the surge, and they're wrong to demand immediate
withdrawal now. Rather than listening to domain.com to set his strategy,
Barack Obama should withhold judgment until he meets with our commanders in
Iraq." =96 Alex Conant, RNC Spokesman

*FLASHBACK:*

*Eli Pariser Wrote An Email To MoveOn Members Claiming They "Bought" And
"Own" The Democrat Party. *"[MoveOn] members received an e-mail urging them
to get involved in the fight over the Organization
chairmanship by contacting state party leaders. In a combative letter,
Pariser wrote, 'Now it's our Party: we bought it, we own it, and we're goin
g
to take it back.'" (Kathryn Williams, "Can MoveOn Move On?," *Newsweek*,
