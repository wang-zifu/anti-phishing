Our new ad: A brave young woman

<<link>>

Walsh for Montana 

Amy, 

Right now, a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions is at risk. That’s why we need to help John defeat Congressman Steve Daines – who would bring a dangerous record against women to the U.S. Senate. 

In the House, Congressman Daines sponsored the most aggressive anti-choice legislation in recent history. He supports a constitutional amendment that would outlaw the right to choose even in cases of rape and incest and would go so far as to make women criminals for having an abortion. 

We can’t allow Congressman Daines to deny us our rights, and Montana women are standing up in the face of these attacks to share their powerful and inspiring stories of courage. 

One of those stories is from an incredible young woman named Melissa. She knows we can’t allow Congressman Daines a vote in the Senate, and so she stepped forward to lend her voice to our fight in a powerful ad we just released. 

Please take a moment to watch this critically important message from Melissa and then donate to help us keep her message on the air for all Montanans to see.

Please watch this critically important message from Melissa.

Melissa’s story is so important because it makes clear exactly what we have to lose. 

This issue is personal for me. During both of my pregnancies, I was hospitalized before my due date. My doctor said John and I may have to make some very tough decisions if my life became threatened. Thankfully, we were blessed with two healthy boys, and we are so grateful for our family. However, we are also fortunate to have had a choice: that if needed, I could make my decision with my family, my doctors and my faith. 

Montana has a strong legacy of electing senators who will stand up for a woman’s right to choose. We know how to win here – we’ve done it before, even when special interest money is bearing down on us. We cannot let Congressman Daines get away with his harmful policies against women and families. Please help us keep Melissa's message on the air.
