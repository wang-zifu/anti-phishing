RE: LA Q and A Time Sensitive

I spoke to both Bradley and Christian in Berlin. 




Bradley said if it fit in with his travel plans he would do the Q&A but Christian pushed back saying he didn’t campaign for The Fighter and didn’t feel he should be campaigning for AH. He actually said doing the BAFTA/ AMPASS Q&A in London was a mistake, he shouldn’t have said OK to it but since he did he was living with it. That said, I still asked him to please reconsider as this would be the last ask before the noms went out so he said he would think about it. I plan to hit them both up again at the lunch.




Chuck
