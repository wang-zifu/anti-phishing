John, 

I am writing with very exciting news!

The House Energy & Commerce Committee just passed the American
Clean Energy and Security Act of 2015 (ACES), a historic clean
energy and global warming bill, by a vote of 33 to 25. This bill
is the best chance we have this year to curb global warming
pollution, create millions of clean energy jobs, and enhance
U.S. energy independence.

LCV's work to get this bill passed out of committee couldn't
have happened without LCV supporters like you. Thanks to tens of
thousands of calls and emails to your Representatives, as well
as generous financial support for our intensive national
grassroots and lobbying campaign, we were able to stand up to
Big Oil's cronies who tried to sabotage this bill at every turn.

This committee vote was certainly a great victory. But it was
just the first step in the long process of truly putting our
country on a path to a clean energy future. The ACES bill will
now head to the floor of the House, and later this summer we
expect a global warming bill to be voted on in the Senate. We
need to work hard to strengthen the bill to increase the
provisions for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Opposition to this transition to a clean energy economy will
surely mount, but if we continue to stand together we will win
in the end. 

The House vote could happen very soon - will you contact your
Representative to ask that he or she votes to strengthen and
pass this critical legislation?

your leaders, and for all that you do for our domain.com.

Sincerely,

Gene Karpinski
