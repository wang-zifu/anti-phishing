Call me next week to set.  SteveSent on the run On Sep 22, 2014, at 11:25 AM, "Day, Logan" <user@domain.com> wrote:Dear Mr. Mosko: My name is Logan Day, and I am an intern here at Sony Pictures Television with the Crackle Operations and Production department. I’m writing to you because I was informed by Michael Maney that you have a passion for the internship program and are willing to share your knowledge. I hope you don’t mind if I take you up on your offer. While I am enjoying my internship with Crackle quite a lot, I am most interested in the creative production—everything from development, to pre-production, to overseeing production, post-production, as well as distribution and marketing—of television shows by Sony Pictures. In a nutshell, I want to know how to be a producer or showrunner in the business. Do you know anyone who would be willing to answer some of my questions about these aspects of creating a television show and perhaps clue me in on the path to becoming a producer as a career? Thank you very much for your time and willingness to assist in making a Sony Pictures Television internship an incredible one. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you do for myself and my fellow interns.  Sincerely, Logan Day
