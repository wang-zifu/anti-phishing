Nelson knows a lot about a lot of things but particularly Latin America.
Notwithstanding his name he is a fluent (maybe native) Spanish speaker.

I wanted to reiterate my offer of help on the campaign, on the policy team
as well as your good suggestion of surrogate work.

Thanks for putting me in touch with the appropriate folks . . .
