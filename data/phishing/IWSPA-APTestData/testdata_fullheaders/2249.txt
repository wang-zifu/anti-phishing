RE: Kevin Hart - International Superstar!

Dear Nigel




The over exposure is certainly something to consider. Opening ABL in ten days there will be no appetite to place any material with him so soon after Ride Along. Even a star of this magnitude has his limits.

Ride Along looks to top out at £3.5m bo with rental est at £900k. With a p and a spend of £1.9m, maybe £2m, that’s a loss of £1-1.1m. Miserable is the word.




Regards




Peter

Jeff,




I love the subject line of this email….!! I assume RIDE ALONG are playing with house money after the excellent US results. In terms of major territories it’s opened in the UK, taking £2.8m after 10 days….’miserable’ according to Peter, and we would need to look at what they spent, to gauge profitability. Other majors dated for RIDE ALONG are Australia (3/20), Germany (4/24) and Italy (5/22). It will be interesting to see how Australia open next week.




ABOUT LAST NIGHT opens in the UK on 3/21, so we may get some pop from Kevin Hart (international superstar, by the way) being in market recently for RIDE ALONG….let’s see. Australia has an NRP for ALN, and Germany goes much later, on 6/19.




And we have THINK LIKE A MAN 2 coming later….Germany in August, UK in September, Australia in November.




One challenge will be over-exposure of Kevin. If he’s just done the media rounds in UK, Australia etc. for RIDE ALONG, I’m not sure how soon he can be there again and get meaningful coverage from the press.




For further discussion, perhaps on the Europe and Australasia calls this week. Looping in Sal and Martin.




Best,

Nigel

Hey JB, I was calling at the end of last week because I had Kevin on the line from Australia. He

had a ball promoting Ride Along and wants to jump in head first on the Screen Gems titles. Let's talk tmw. In the interim check these out:
