We looked at DWS schedule but it was too packed. We often do include her on talkers calls, but if she's not available we hold them anyway as necessary. We'll do another one with her next week.

Thanks, Tracie. That's a great idea.

I've also made sure that the Sanders folks have these messaging points.
