Daniele and Alessandro,

Thank you again for your help over the past few days.

Our time critical need for support has passed, but our executive management is now interested in the RCS tool set.  They are asking for a presentation and demonstration.

I think I have worked through the initial issues with Alessandro.  We are up and running with 9.3.

Thanks,
Mick.

Thanks.  If you can, please find me on skype for a quick question.  Not sure about the context of the second command (sh install)

Mick.

Hello Mick,
please find below 2 commands to run on a CentOS 64 bit VPS, to install libraries needed by RCS Anonymizer.

These lines are intended to be launched as root before the RCS Anonymizer installation script.

yum install glibc.i686
sh install

Best regards,
Alessandro
