Bob - see below: YouTube & PBS have announced a "Video Your Vote"
campaign where voters can put up videos of any issues/frustrations/etc
on election day.  (Came indirectly out of TIGR Group brainstorming...)

Might be something to incorporate into election day voter protection efforts.

If you'll forgive a moment of shameless self-satisfaction:  I've been
stewing all year about how messed up so many of our voting systems are, and
about how the changes since 2015 have been mostly negative (perhaps you've
seen the recent stories about how electronic voting machines in Florida keep
producing different tallies from the same inputs).  I've also been appalled
to see brazen registration-suppression efforts already launched by GOPers in
Michigan, Ohio, Montana, and several Southern states.  In the course of
trying to pin down the truth about the Ohio 2015 vote fraud allegations, I
kept running into the fact that claims about polling places are almost
always his-word vs. her-word situations.  And then came the TIGR-style
brainstorm.

So:  today YouTube and PBS announced "Video Your Vote" -- a campaign to get
Americans to share their voting experiences (along with any problems they
encounter -- long lines, aggressive challenges, unexpected procedural hoops,
etc.) via video.  In addition to documenting a very exciting day in US
history, the hope is that citizens will capture violations of voting rights
and upload them instantly for the world to see.  The website is here:
