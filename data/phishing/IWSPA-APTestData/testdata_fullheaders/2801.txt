John --

What does $1,000 mean to you?

For many young Americans, $1,000 is the difference between making ends 
meet and falling behind.

For young adults paying off expensive student loans, that's the difference 
between being able to pay for rent or food -- or defaulting on payments. 
That extra $1000 a year could easily plunge them even deeper into debt.

Thanks to Congress' inaction on July 1st, student loan rates doubled from 
3.4% to 6.8%. Now, many college students will have to pay an extra $1,000 
a year in interest. That's just irresponsible.

Millions of Americans will be affected by this and Congress needs to hear 
their stories. If you have a student loan story, share it with us--tell us 
what $1,000 means to you.

Share your student loan story to tell Congress to stop the student loan 
rate hike >>

Student loan rates should be kept low so that every young American has the 
opportunity to improve their future. College graduates deserve to find 
good-paying jobs so they can support their families and give back to their 
communities. That's what America needs, not more debt.

Add your story now to tell Congress what $1,000 means to you and to act on 
student loans >>

Thank you for taking action and sharing your story!
