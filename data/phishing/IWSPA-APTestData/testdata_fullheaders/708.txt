Re: THE THICKETY: A PATH BEGINS by J. A. White

Just spoke with Mark James he says The Director, which we've obviously got, and the Ishiguro Rudin bookare really what you should know about besides Thickety. He's gonna send me anything else he thinks of. Will send coverage of Thickety as soon as it surfaces
