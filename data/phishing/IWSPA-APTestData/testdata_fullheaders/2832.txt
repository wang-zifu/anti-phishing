	Hello Team,Just a quick note about our meeting with Vancouver PD.  We presented to the Cyber Crime team and the intelligence group.  In our pre demo meeting with the groups I asked what the main concerns were and why they though of us.  Their first concern was iMessages with iPhone.  I confirmed and agreed with Alessandro that we were able to capture the data, then announce to the groups that we will be seeing that function.  They asked to hold off on that demo till the Captain was able to join us.  We proceed with the demo, infecting the target via TNI YouTube.  The infection was flawless and we had a great demo.  We got word that the captain was not going to be available.  We infected the iPhone and were able to demo it with collection of iMessage.  We also demo'ed the the BB and Android as well.  Impressed with the demo they asked for price.  It seems that the system is something they can purchase if the price remains in the low 300K upper 200K.  Someone from their group will be at ISS DC and will attend the Demo we will be giving there as well.  If the captain is attending and available they will ask for a private demo at the show.Over all the demo was a success and I beleve they are serious about acquiring the system.  Off to NYC
