Today's Event: "a fun Sony experience"

Dear Michael and Amy,




I would feel amiss if I didn’t share the amazing feedback I heard, both in person out on Main Street and in Calley Park today, and from emails this afternoon. Without exception, the employees truly appreciated that you did this for them – they felt the love! As one long-timer told me, “It’s like one of the big parties we used to have…before the recession.” 




Copying in some email below.




Have a wonderful weekend,




Lucienne

Dear Lucienne,




I hope that this email finds you well. I just wanted to let you know how great the Awards Celebration BBQ was today. The food was fantastic, and it was overall a wonderful experience. I really appreciate the hard work that your team put in to the event.




Also, I have to tell you – my clients absolutely loved it. Many of them made comments about how it was a treat for them to be a part of a fun Sony experience like the BBQ today.  




Kind regards,
