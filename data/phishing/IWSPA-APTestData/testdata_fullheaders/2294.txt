Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, 
I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2015 Issue of the Digital 
Edition and see if you like reading the mag in that 
format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated domain.com.

I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion. 

See You in August,              Randy Nieland

LDAP domain.com
Pondered by Warren Dugas

"Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?"

History of LDAP 

<<link>>

X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications. 

DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windows operating system or the Macintosh. 

The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
domain.com. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Hollett

<<link>>
<<link>>

"I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point."

Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. 

His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an "initial" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released

<<link>>

With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux

<<link>>

WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
domain.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.
