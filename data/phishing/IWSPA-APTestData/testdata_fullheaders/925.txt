Netflix announces a June 4K avail of "Breaking Bad"




Hi Michael,




Netflix announced today that BREAKING BAD would be available in 4K in June.  Attached is one link though several other sites have picked up the story as well.  We’re working on a 4K amendment (still unsigned) so this was a surprise to us.  Paula Askanas has reached out to Netflix already.  Sony has been supportive of Netflix and 4K announces around CES and NAB but we’ve never agreed to announce a 4K date for specific product.   Wanted to make sure you are aware.
