Found them. They got sort of buried. Sorry for false alarm.

Hi John,

Below is a list of the documents that were supposed to appear in your iBook
s App. Attached to this email are PDF copies of every document (including t
he Energy Facts, just in case it is deleted this time). Since you're receiv
ing this message in your gmail inbox as well as your CAP inbox you should b
e able to open it directly on your iPad through the Email App. When you ope
n the email simply click on each document one by one. When the document ope
ns in the Email App if you touch the top of the document it should give you
 the option to "open this document in iBooks." Click that button and the iP
ad should bring you directly to the iBooks App and automatically open the d
ocument in the App. You'll have to then go back to your Email App and repea
t this process with each remaining document. Each document is named precise
ly in accordance to this list, so it should be relatively easy to tell whic
h document is which. Does that make sense? This is actually how I loaded th
e documents to the iPad in the first place (only I did it via my own gmail)
. I'll be waiting to hear whether or not your successful!
