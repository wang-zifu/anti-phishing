*WP:EPA Proposal Would Loosen Rules for Air in National Parks

*

By Juliet Eilperin
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, November 19, 2008; A01

The Environmental Protection Agency is finalizing new air-quality rules that
would make it easier to build coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and
other major polluters near national parks and wilderness areas, even though
half of the EPA's 10 regional administrators formally dissented from the
decision and four others criticized the move in writing.

Documents obtained by The Washington Post show that the administration's
push to weaken Clean Air Act protections for "Class 1 areas" nationwide has
sparked fierce resistance from senior agency officials. All but two of the
regional administrators objecting to the proposed rule are political
appointees.

The proposal would change the practice of measuring pollution levels near
national parks, which is currently done over three-hour and 24-hour
increments to capture emission spikes during periods of peak energy demand;
instead, the levels would be averaged over a year. Under this system, spikes
in pollution would no longer violate the law.

In written submissions, EPA regional administrators have argued that this
switch would undermine critical air-quality protections for parks such as
Virginia's Shenandoah, which is frequently plagued by smog and poor
visibility.

EPA Region 4 Administrator J. I. Palmer Jr., whose office oversees the
Southeast, wrote that the new formula "would reduce consistency, accuracy
and public review" and "could allow greater deterioration of air quality in
clean areas rather than preventing significant deterioration."

Bharat Mathur, who until recently oversaw air quality for the Great Lakes
states as acting administrator for Region 5, wrote, "The proposed approach
is inappropriate and could lead to gaming the increment calculation." And
Region 8 acting Administrator Carol Rushin, whose office covers Colorado,
Wyoming, Utah, Montana, and North and South Dakota, wrote that the rule
provides "inappropriate discretion" when calculating pollution levels.

EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said in an e-mail that he could not comment
in detail on the air-quality rule but said that the submissions "are all
part of the regular agency process, so all I can say is that that process
has been moving forward."

The EPA could issue the final rule as early as this week. Shradar wrote that
"work continues on a number of rules including the [Class 1 areas] rule, but
no timeline has been set for completion at this point."

Many national parks struggle with poor visibility shrouding otherwise
spectacular vistas, as well as acid rain and other problems caused by air
pollution, a situation that has intensified the debate over how best to
regulate lead smelters, coal-fired power plants and other nearby pollution
sources.

Don Shepherd, an environmental engineer at the National Park Service's air
resources division in Denver, noted that the agency determined in the 1980s
that every one of its parks was "visually impaired," and "nothing really has
changed that." Visitors to Shenandoah National Park's Skyline Drive in the
mid-1930s reported seeing the Washington Monument more than 70 miles away;
now, on some days, visibility is barely one mile.

"The approach that's being proposed is going to underestimate the emissions,
both for power plants that are out there now and for the ones that are
proposed," Shepherd said. "It's going in the wrong direction for our efforts
to try to improve air quality in the parks."

While limiting pollution in national parks does not have the broad public
health implications of federal air-quality rules that govern soot or
airborne lead pollution, it has symbolic and ecological importance. The four
major pollutants affecting the parks -- sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
carbon dioxide and mercury -- contribute to degrading once-pristine habitats
that Congress sought to preserve for generations when it decided to protect
those areas.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead -- who helped initiate the rule change while chief of
EPA's air and radiation office and who now heads the environmental
strategies group at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani -- said it is
unsurprising that regional officials would have a position different from
that at headquarters.

"The headquarters perspective tends to be much broader," Holmstead said,
adding that the Bush administration has pursued air pollution reductions but
has seen its proposals tied up in court. "Air quality in national parks, in
particular, has very little to do with an individual source. What you really
want to do is lower air pollution in that region."

Regional EPA officials, he added, want "every weapon in their arsenal" to
reduce pollution from a given source: "Regions are focused on a domain.com for a
specific plant. Often what they focus on is anything that gives them
leverage."

But Mark Wenzler, who directs clean-air programs for the National Parks
Conservation Association, said regional administrators "weren't just looking
at parochial concerns" but instead conducting a broad analysis of the rule's
impact.

"The administration's staunch commitment to coal is so deep that they're
willing to sacrifice our national parks on the way out the door," he said.

If the EPA adopts the rule change, Wenzler added, his group plans to file a
petition for reconsideration with the agency, which would allow the incoming
Obama administration to reverse the policy. If the new rule is enacted, the
association estimates it would ease the way for the construction of at least
two dozen coal-fired utilities within 186 miles of 10 national parks.
