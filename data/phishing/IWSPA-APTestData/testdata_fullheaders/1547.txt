After several conversations we have determined the best way to proceed with
donor meetings in 2015 as follows:

A personal letter from John user, Paul Begala and Rob McKay will go out
to all FFA donors and prospective donors inviting them to attend the
Carlsbad DA conference and will mention a follow up meeting in NYC. (Marc
Elias/Christine Varney are currently reviewing the letter)

At the DA conference there will be presentation(s) that highlight the work
we are all suppoting.  user will be featured in one session.  In a
seperate session Begala will be featured.

user, or a representative; Begala; Dacey; Stocks; a rep from the c4, are
invited to be part of the planning brain trust that will design and shape
each discussion.

Mid March we will send out a mailing to all donors and prospective donors
for FFA inviting them to an update briefing in NYC mid May.

FFA will be the sole host of the NYC meeting and we will have a half day
presentation and small social event for the program.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding these
meetings.
