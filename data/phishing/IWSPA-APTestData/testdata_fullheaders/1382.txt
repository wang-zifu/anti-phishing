OUTSTANDING DRAMA & COMEDY SERIES




The Emmy Handicap: Can Big Bang Theory & True Detective Change the Tide & Win?

Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series are more about the season as a whole: producers of each nominated show choose six episodes that get randomly distributed to three different groups of Academy voters, which view two episodes each. With that in mind, what follows is SSN’s quick and dirty handicap of the two biggest series races, here (SSN)



Emmy Spotlight: Prolific Producer Chuck Lorre Talks Big Bang Theory & Sheldon's Watershed Moment

Prolific television producer Chuck Lorre currently has four television series on-air: Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Mike & Molly, and Mom. All are in the Top 20 among adults 18 – 49, a first for a showrunner. Lorre spoke to SSN about Big Bang’s Emmy nominations, Men’s upcoming final season, and those famous Vanity Cards at the end of each episode. (SSN)



Emmy Spotlight: Mad Men Creator Matthew Weiner Reveals the Emmy Snub that Shocked Him

With the 2015 premiere of his signature creation Mad Men, AMC ventured for the first time into original scripted programming. Now, four Emmys for Best Drama (and dozens of nominations) later, Weiner’s baby is once again nominated for the top prize, following a shortened, seven-episode season that saw something of a rebirth for main character Don Draper. SSN’s interview with Weiner starts here (SSN)
