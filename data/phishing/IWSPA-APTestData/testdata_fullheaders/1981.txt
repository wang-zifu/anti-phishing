Update on mail screening room at Water Street

GSA has agreed to modify their general clauses section and has communicated that to Cushman Wakefield and so we have cleared that major hurdle, the hold up for the past month or so.  GSA has now asked to see the Cushman Wakefield standard lease agreement in the hopes that they can just use that one.  So we are making progress with this step - finally.

Thanks, Laura
