									Happy New Year number 5775!



									And many of as you know, today completes Rosh Hashanah. For those of us who celebrate the Jewish holidays, this is a time to reflect, recharge, and reset our intentions for the year ahead.



									Yesterday I attended a beautiful service led by ZEITGUIDE friend and teacher, Amichai Lau-Lavie, founder of Lab/SHUL, an “everybody friendly, artist-driven, experimental community” that seeks to re-imagine the role of sacred gatherings for contemporary spiritual needs.



									Lau-Lavie suggested four simple words that anyone of any faith could use as guideposts as we start a new year.



									GRATITUDE: No matter where life takes us, no matter how frustrated we are, we should be grateful for everything we have.



									WOW: Each day we should be curious and open to the inspiration that comes from new people and experiences.



									OOPS: We are just going to make mistakes. We have to accept that, accept ourselves, and move on.



									PLEASE: There is no shame in asking for help.



									In many of our Zeitguides in recent years, we’ve touched on how important it is for creative leaders to reflect, to stay mindful, and to grow in their self-awareness. The 10Q project, developed by the thoughtful folks at Reboot, is one modern, digital way anyone can take part in this time of reflection and renewal. Answer a question a day, and then be reminded next new year where you were so you can see where you’ve gone.



									To help you reflect on our constantly changing culture and how it’s affecting your businesses and lives, below is a list of all our 2015 newsletters.
