Consumer domain.com Merges a Global CPG Customer Segmentation with Rentrak Local and National TV Ratings

CONSUMER ORBIT MERGES A GLOBAL CPG CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION WITH RENTRAK’S LOCAL AND NATIONAL TV RATINGS

PORTLAND, OR (JULY 10, 2014) – Rentrak, the leader in precisely measuring movies and TV everywhere, and Consumer domain.com, a consumer science company, today announced a major integration of a global well-known CPG advertiser’s customer segmentation system merged with Rentrak’s local market and national television ratings. Consumer domain.com will use Rentrak ratings with its targeted segments to plan the advertiser’s local and national television campaigns for the coming year. The client’s buying agency will be onboarded with the highly targeted program ratings for the placement cycle.

“The ability to bypass age and sex demographics and target the actual segments that drive our strategy across all media is the final step in integrating all of our client’s marketing around the customer targets that drive their business,” said Jay Huckabay, president and chief executive officer of Consumer domain.com. “Now our actual television plan and buy will be specified by customer segment matching the creative, merchandising and full media mix effort so that the entire marketing chain will be united around priority targets for specific products. By tracking sales on a weekly basis within a customer segment, we can throttle the execution at the local market level as conditions demand.”

“The technique opens the door to advertisers to close the loop in their targeting systems by making their television plans and buys responsive to the internal market segment research that has become the language of communication within the marketing group for each brand,” said Chris Wilson, president of national television of Rentrak. “With more and more brands tracking sales by customer segment, it makes sense that media planning and buying follow domain.com.”
