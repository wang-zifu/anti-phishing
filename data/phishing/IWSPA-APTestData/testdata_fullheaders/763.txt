Former Trump Exec Barbara Res Q&A with the NYT

-          Trump hires a lot of people on impulse

-          On VP, doesn't look like he's looking for people that will stand up to him

-          Story about fichus trees

-          Donald has no restraint. Thinks he's great for women, but says terrible things about women

-          Accuses Trump of potentially taking advantage of a "PR situation" in taking out ad against Central Park 5

-          Trump was resentful of the Japanese

-          Says Donald Trump commented on his daughter related to his financial fortunes: Depending on how well I do, she will either be a local beauty, a national beauty, or an international beauty

-          Admits to occasionally being afraid of Donald: "He's a very scary guy."

-          Says Trump always used to talk about running for president, but no one that worked with him took it seriously

-          "He thinks he is going to be king"
