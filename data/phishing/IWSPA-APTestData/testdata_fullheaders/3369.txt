RE: what a triumph

Yes, cards were helpful.  

I'm going to soften CD a bit -- but still maintain her as a villain.  There are a few places I can do this I think.  I agree wit her not saying "smart ass" -- it's not on story anyway.  I'll fix it.

Helicopter scene will be fixed by going back to longer version but still not getting into the song in a creepy way.  

The fake parents are interesting in that they have to be both threatening but not super scary -- I think I can do this with different performances.  I had them play the gamut from scary to goofy.  I will look.

I want to have another screening in the Backstage (non-Stadium seating) soon with the changes to get a read.

And the only time I'll lock the movie is when they tear it from my hands to make prints!!  Things can always be improved....

95 means there's 5 more for the taking....

Subject: what a triumph

cards very clear

we need  to help poor cameron  be a "villain" "they love

something is really getting in the way of  them enjoying her ....maybe we alittle broader is better than too mean?maybe they have to know there  is a heart inthere some where so your rooting for it to emerge...maybe the images of   the little  girls inlittle girls  in  gettting in the way .. they dont like her over sexuality and 'cussing" (smart ass)i i wonder which thing it really is( they dont like the social worker swearing either....jezzzzz)

 easy street we know we have to look at again

also it seems like they need to know alittle more about the motivation for the fake parents....im actually thinking less is more . we can discuss..now its kind of inbetween ad maybe thats confusing....thekids dont like it because they dont like what happening to annie but there may be a little correction we need to make here...not sure

there are a few mentions of the heliocopter scene (obviously not the same as what i was saying but it may have sometehing to do with what you guys were saying)i think its just not exactly right yet but jamies singing style is different and there could be something there people are responding to

anyway amazing....and by the way we could also just take our 95 and lock it too

xxxxx
