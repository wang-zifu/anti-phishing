*Pawlenty=92s Courage? Not in Minnesota*

*St. Paul, Minn. -* Tim Pawlenty=92s record in Minnesota is anything but
courageous.  As he embarks on a national tour today to promote his book *Th
e
Courage to Stand*, Minnesotans have not forgotten the mess he left behind a
s
governor.  Tim Pawlenty=92s tax increases and his $6.2 billion budget defic
it
will continue to plague Minnesota long after he is gone.  A state-based
group, Alliance for a Better Minnesota, launched:
domain.com<<<link>>
uIEN_wdjLx-A..>as
a way to share the facts about Pawlentys legacy with those outside of
the
state.

Alliance for a Better Minnesota Executive Director Denise Cardinal released
the following statement:

"Tim Pawlenty spent eight years unfairly increasing the tax burden on
middle-class Minnesotans while failing to show strong leadership and balanc
e
Minnesota=92s budget.  Minnesotans saw higher taxes, fiscal recklessness an
d
an aversion to making tough choices from Governor Pawlenty, but we certainl
y
never saw courage."

The reality of Governor Pawlenty=92s legacy is that he has left the state i
n
shambles.  His lack of leadership has saddled the state with a $6.2 billion
dollar domain.com and his failure to show leadership on tough issues ensured
that middle-class Minnesotans paid higher taxes throughout his eight years
as governor.

Pawlenty cut state aid to local governments by $2.6 billion dollars over
eight years, which caused property taxes for Minnesota homeowners to
skyrocket over that same time period.  Over 90% of Minnesotans have seen
their state and local tax rates increase since 2002, with the richest 10% o
f
Minnesotans remaining relatively unaffected.

In addition, Governor Pawlenty=92s cut state spending on higher education o
ver
15% during his eight years as Governor.  These cuts have resulted in an 80%
increase in tuition to his alma mater, the University of Minnesota, putting
the education that allowed him to succeed further and further from the reac
h
of middle-class Minnesotans.
