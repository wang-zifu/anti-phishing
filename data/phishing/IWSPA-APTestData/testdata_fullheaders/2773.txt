Blog: Harnessing Momentum for the Next 20 Years of Environmetnal Justice

Check out our latest blog post, 100th Blog Post - Harnessing Momentum for t
he Next 20 Years of Environmetnal Justice by Mustafa Ali. In today's post, 
Mustafa highlights some of the most compelling successes of Environmental J
ustice written about in the blog since its inception in 2012.

Also, check out our new Climate Justice in Action Series, which focuses on 
reframing the conversation on climate change to include environmental justi
ce issues. Read our kickoff post featuring a video from Administrator McCar
thy, and contribute success stories from your local area on our interactive
 climate justice map. In the last post in the series, Rev. Lennox Yearwood 
talks about why it is so imperative for us to act on climate both in terms 
of the economic, environmental, and public health benefits of action and th
e costs of inaction. He also highlights EPA's Clean Power Plan and how you 
can provide comments.
