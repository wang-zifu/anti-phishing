Looks like there's some nice open spaces so you should be able to catch up on things.

10:00am: Senior Staff meeting
3:00pm: Meet Gustavo Arnavat (not sure where)

Senior staff schedule:

  *   SCOTUS Update
  *   2015 Planning
  *   Department Updates
  *   Operations Updates

Also, I asked Marilyn, Miles, and Bridgette about the Young Democrats of America Hispanic Caucus, and they said it is not an official part of the Organizationbut they would recommend doing the call. They said "we treat them like any other allied group." Let me know if I should reach out to schedule, or if you'd like to pass it to Pablo.
