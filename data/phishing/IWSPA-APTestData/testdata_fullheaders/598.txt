Ryan sets schedule for Thursday Trump meetings<<<link>>#ixzz48HhoC6fr>

Donald Trump will meet face-to-face with Speaker Paul Ryan at 9 a.m. on Thursday at the RNC, according to a GOP leadership source familiar with the schedule.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus will sit in the meeting, too.

A second meeting including Ryan, Trump and a larger roster of GOP leadership will follow. Attendees will include Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), and Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)

There will be no press availability after, but Ryan will do an on-camera availability later that morning, the source said.

Trump has no plans to meet with Trump endorsers at this time, according to two additional sources familiar with this schedule. But supporters will meet Friday morning with the Trump campaign's Hill liaisons to discuss how the meeting went and next steps forward.
