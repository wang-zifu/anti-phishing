   John,

   The last few Democratic debates have left me astounded.

   Reproductive freedom is at serious risk in this country. But still, not a
   single question about abortion rights has been asked at ANY of the five
   Democratic debates. Not one.

   On Thursday night, PBS NewsHour's Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff will make
   up the first all-woman moderating team of any debate. [1]Click here to
   tell them to ask the candidates a question about how they'll defend and
   expand abortion rights in the face of historic challenges to reproductive
   freedom.

   Lately, a lot of people have been asking me why it's important to have t
he
   two Democratic candidates debate abortion, when they both clearly have
   strong pro-choice voting records.

   I can tell you exactly why it matters: Being *just* pro-choice is not
   enough anymore. Not now, when we face an anti-choice majority in Congress
   and anti-choice state governments and a field of rabidly anti-choice GOP
   presidential candidates who are determined to ban abortion.

   The voters deserve a chance to watch Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton
   race to the top on this issue.

   In the first few weeks of 2015 alone, state legislatures have introduced
   147 anti-choice bills. That's an average of five per day. And in just
   three weeks, the Supreme Court will hear the case out of Texas that could
   redefine abortion access for a generation. What will the candidates do to
   address the very real crisis of abortion clinics shuttering across the
   country?

   Women on Medicaid are already barred from using their insurance to cover
   the cost of abortion, which means low-income people and women of color a
re
   overwhelmingly affected. How will these candidates, who are far surpassi
ng
   the Republicans when it comes to addressing the issues that matter to
   people of color, reconcile this and make substantive change?

   [2]Will you add your name to tell the moderators to ask a question about
   abortion access at the next Democratic debate?

   Access to abortion is central to the values we hold dear as Americans--t
he
   ability to plan one's future and control one's own destiny, the power to
   decide when and if and how to become a parent and start a family. When I
   was 19, I had an abortion because I wasn't ready to become a parent, and
   it was the best decision for me.

   What's important now is a candidate's willingness to go above and beyond,
   to demonstrate that they're a die-hard supporter of reproductive freedom
   and will do whatever it takes to make sure access to abortion is protect
ed
   and expanded.

   We need as many people as possible to sign this petition so we can make 
an
   impact on the moderators as they're finalizing their question choices for
   the debate Thursday night. [3]Click here to add your name and call on PBS
   moderators Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff to #AskAboutAbortion on Thursday.

   Thank you for all you do for reproductive freedom.
