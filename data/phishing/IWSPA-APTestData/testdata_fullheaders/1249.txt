Re: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2- International

The target for Australia that we have is $13.5m. Hotel T opened to $1,370m on the way to $12,446m (9.1 multiple). If we do a similar multiple we will exceed the target. Not sure where Stephen thinks we will end up. Unfortunately, we have Frozen right before Christmas entering the market which should be strong competition but as you can see Stephen feels like we are in very good shape. I suspect we will have a clearer picture once we see how we hold up to Frozen during the holiday period.Â
