RE: Looking to Set a Screening of THE REMAINING for Steven & Team

Very small film, faith based.  Ralph, Steve B, Ivan, Freddy invited but it is optional.

Hi Christina,




Nice to ‘meet’ you on the phone. J  As we discussed, Steven and Rich Peluso spoke about setting a screening of THE REMAINING for Steven and those on his team he’d like to see it.  If you could please let me know what works for SPRI skeds, I’ll match up with a Jimmy Stewart screening room and schedule this puppy.




Many thanks for your help in setting this.




Kind regards.

- Angie
