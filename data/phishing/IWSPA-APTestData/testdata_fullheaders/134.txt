Hey dude:

Will let you know if I encounter any last minute openings.  The tickets hav
e been tougher than usual this year bc so many reporters seem to be invitin
g their campaign sources - so the pool of potential invitees is somewhat la
rger than usual.  But, if something opens up, I will absolutely keep them i
n mind.

Thanks for reaching out.  Hope all is well over there.

Josh

Hey Josh, I'm already in at WHCD as is the Chair. However, if you have extr
a slots you get for those back tables for junior staff, it would be great i
f we could take care of extra Organizationcomm staffers who as you know I've made s
ure are aggressive about touting the progress we've made over the last 7 ye
ars.
