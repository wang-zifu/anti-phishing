Alessandra,

From Sales dept, please add Daniel Maglietta, Ryan and D. Martinez.
Please ask Alessandro about the 2 FAEs, at least one that speaks spanish.

Giancarlo, instead to hire a local receptionist, why don't ask Alessandra that
speaks English, French, Russian and a little bit of Italian? :))

Marco
