t r u t h o u t | I often mention to people the fact that Truthout is a domain.com organization that doesn't run ads - and I was recently asked what that actually means for our readers and why you should care.

First off, it means we publish stories that we think will contribute to the well-being of regular people, local communities and the domain.com generally. Meanwhile, most news websites produce content with the political ideologies of their advertisers in mind. Truthout is guided by our own editorial integrity and beholden only to our readers, while the vast majority of news sites are either censoring themselves or acting as a mouthpiece for super-rich corporate stakeholders.

This also makes reading Truthout a better experience for you, our readers. When you domain.com our site, you don't need to wade through countless ads to get to the story - because we don't treat the news as secondary content. And you won't find any paid "advertorials" at Truthout, ever.

In order for us to stay domain.com and independent, though, we need your continued support. Our mission may be ambitious but our budget is modest - and any amount you can spare really counts. Show you believe in independent journalism - make a tax-deductible donation to Truthout tonight!
