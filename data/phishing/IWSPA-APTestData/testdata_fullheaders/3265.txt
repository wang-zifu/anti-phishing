Inhofe: Sotomayor Is a 'Racist,' But Strom Thurmond Is A 'Great American' <
<<link>>>

Echoing statements by nativist former Rep. Tom Tancredo<<<link>>
s.org/2009/05/27/tancredo-sotomayor-racist/> (R-CO) and former KKK Imperial
 Wizard David Duke<<<link>>

yor a "racist<<<link>>
ys-sotomayors-sp.html>" today on the Senate floor.  Watch it:

[YOUTUBE]

Interestingly, while Inhofe is convinced that the first Latina nominee to t
he Supreme Court is consumed by racial animus, he had very different things
 to say about a fellow Southern white conservative.  After former Sen. Tren
t Lott (R-MS) claimed that America would have avoided "all these problems<h
ttp://domain.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/09/lott.comment/>" if it had put
 a segregationist in the White House, Inhofe quickly came to Lott's defense
<<<link>>>:

"In an effort to honor the life and service of Strom Thurmond, Senator Lott
 made some comments that he probably wishes he had phrased differently," In
hofe said. "I do not believe Senator Lott meant to be malicious or racist w
ith the comments he made. I believe he was merely honoring a great American
 on his 100th birthday, but I believe he is right to apologize for the word
s he used. Racism of any type must not be tolerated.

"Many have been quick to criticize Lott, but few have been quick to accept 
his apology. I do not believe he harbors racist sentiments in his heart. He
 has apologized and appropriately clarified the meaning of his statements. 
I believe we should accept his apology and move forward."

In Jim Inhofe's America, Sonia Sotomayor is a dangerous bigot who must be s
topped, but Strom Thurmond is a "great American."
