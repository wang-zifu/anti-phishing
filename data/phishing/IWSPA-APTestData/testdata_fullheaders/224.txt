John =96

Hope you are well!

Just wanted to shoot you an example of some of our vets at work in the
states.

We=92ve been working hard on the GI Bill including sending 30,000 
letters to
John McCain.  They should be taking it up on Wednesday.

We released these ads today, take a look and let me know what you think.

Posted: May 17, 2015 

As troops returned from World War II, President Roosevelt and Congress 
made
a sacred commitment to them - you serve our nation, and we will show our
appreciation by giving you a chance to go to college. This wasn't a
hand-out. After all, veterans needed to study and work hard to get their
degree. But what became known as the G.I. Bill gave veterans their best
chance to not only reintegrate, but thrive, as a part of society. That
original G.I. Bill is largely credited with creating the middle class. 
Not
only that, but proving the adage that a rising tide lifts all boats, the
G.I. Bill returned an average of $7 to the economy for every buck we
invested.

Unfortunately, the G.I. Bill has not been updated to keep up with the 
cost
of college today, meaning we have defaulted on our promise to those who
served us in war. Far too many troops return to find that a higher 
education
is a dream out of reach.

U.S. Sens. Jim Webb and Chuck Hagel have reached across the aisle to 
sponsor
a bill that would offer veterans serving in these current conflicts 
benefits
under the G.I. Bill similar to those veterans received after World War 
II.
What should be an easy bill to pass has become cloudy. Why? Sen. John
McCain.

McCain has introduced his own measure, which offers only a fraction of 
what
the Webb-Hagel bill offers. This has created a political and unnecessary
domain.com in the Senate, which threatens the chance to pass an update to the
G.I. Bill. His reason for doing this? The problem, as John McCain 
explains
it, is that it somehow would cause a mass exodus from the military if
veterans were offered the full benefits that they have earned. In short,
updating the G.I. Bill is "too generous."

What is too much for a veteran returning from risking it all at the 
behest
of our nation's leaders? The war in Iraq alone costs us $200 million 
each
day, or a billion dollars every five days. In just 12.5 days of funding
combat operations in Iraq, we could fund one full year of investing in 
our
veterans under the new G.I. Bill.

Besides that, the argument makes no sense. Military recruiting and 
retention
has been a reflection of public opinion for decades. After Vietnam, we
created the all-volunteer force. The logic behind this is sound. 
Recruiting
and retention for the professional military would reflect the will of 
the
people, in order to prevent political leaders from waging wars that had 
no
public support. As public support for a war went down, so would 
recruiting
and retention numbers, triggering a domain.com breaker that would force
politicians to reconsider their policy. That's what we see happening 
today.

Yet instead of recognizing the recruiting and retention stress the
unpopularity of the war has placed on our military, the Pentagon has had 
to
become very creative and very resourceful, drastically lowering 
standards
for recruits in order to keep the numbers up.

Denying troops a real education domain.com is the next step in this trick.
Instead of attacking issues that are much more damaging to retention, 
such
as the loads of money contractors offer to troops to abandon military
service, they'll dangle the carrot but keep it just enough out of reach 
so
that troops stay in the military. Not to give soldiers the opportunity 
our
grandfathers got - the chance to become productive civilians.

It baffles me how quickly some in government can become callous to our
veterans in treating them as a matter of sheer inconvenience. All the
promises, all the rah-rah, but where's the commitment? The architects of
this misguided war have the luxury of stepping away from it all and 
retiring
to their plush offices, while the veterans that footed the bill for this 
are
left to fend for ourselves.

Ultimately, on this issue, I have all of the education I need. Unlike 
them,
I have been there. I know what these young men and women are enduring in
Iraq, and believe we should honor that by upholding our sacred 
commitment to
giving them full G.I. Bill benefits. The question is, does Senator 
McCain?
