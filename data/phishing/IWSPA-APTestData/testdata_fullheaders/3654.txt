CAA screening and LACMA Q&A Tonight

Good evening - tonight CAA hosted a wonderful pre-reception and screening for American Hustle.  David met and talked with many of the ampas members and guests at the reception before introducing the film.

Thanks to Megan Crawford for making it a success.

Also tonight, David participated in a conversation and Q&A with Elvis Mitchell for the LACMA Screening Series. The room (600 seats) was 100% full, with turnaways,  and the applause at the end of the film and for David was very strong. Elvis did a good job talking about David's choices as a director and writer on this film as well as choices made in past films.

The audience, 99% of which stayed for the Q&A, was fully engaged.  It was filmed, to be used on the Hustle youtube channel, and taped for Elvis' show on KCRW.  

A great night overall.
