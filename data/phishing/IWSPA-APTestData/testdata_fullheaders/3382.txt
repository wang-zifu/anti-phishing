Protect Israel from a Nuclear Iran

Dear Amy,




Donate by MidnightOn April 7, the P5+1 world powers and Iran will resume talks in Vienna, as part of our ongoing struggle to keep Iran from going nuclear.




You know Iran cannot be trusted. Any final deal from these talks must stop Iran, the world’s leading sponsor of terror, from having a uranium or plutonium path to nuclear weapons – or risk putting Israel, the U.S. and the world in unprecedented danger.




The Israel Project is committed to protecting Israel – and to getting the right information out to journalists, policymakers and the public – but we need your help to reach our goal of $10,000 by March 31.  With just one week until the upcoming negotiations, we can’t take any chances.  




Please, make a contribution today– before midnight – and a generous donor will match your gift, doubling your impact.




Click here to make your donation of $18, $36, $50 or more go twice as far – and help The Israel Project get the truth out about Iran’s nuclear drive.




Speaking to key journalists and policymakers on a TIP-sponsored briefing call last month, top defense analyst Greg Jones warned that permitting Iran to continue enriching uranium risked a global domino effect. His dark forecast was picked up and echoed by numerous news outlets, including the BBC, TIME Magazine and The Daily Beast.  domain.com ensures stakeholders and others understand the news, with a post showcasing how Iran’s nuclear drive and nuclear proliferation is already destabilizing the region, as Saudi Arabia and other players look to grow nuclear stockpiles of their own.  




The Israel Project’s events and print and online publications, including The Tower Magazine, our blog,emails, social media, and our strategic communications hub, domain.com, are all part of our comprehensive campaign to keep the media, policymakers and the public informed about the grave threats posed by Iran’s nuclear program.




It’s devastating to think that in less than four months, the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism – and Israel’s greatest threat – could achieve critical capacity – the ability to rush across the nuclear finish line at any moment. We must ensure that the final deal dismantles Iran’s nuclear infrastructure – before it’s too late.




Please help us meet our goal of $10,000 by midnight, so this unthinkable future never becomes a reality.
