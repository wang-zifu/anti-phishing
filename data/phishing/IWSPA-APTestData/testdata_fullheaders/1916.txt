John,



What a remarkably successful transition you are creating.  
I'd like to connect with the efforts to build support for the  
Administration's agenda and/or with the continuing volunteer operation.  If  you have any 
advice on how I might be helpful in either area, I would certainly  appreciate 
your advice.



With appreciation and hope for this change,
Heather Booth
