Re: I have a HUGE idea

Just wanted to make sure everyone had the update on Jonah's recent press schedule. He did a terrific job yesterday on both Howard Stern and Fallon and this morning GMA addressed the incident and quickly moved on. By the time he got to Kelly & Michael, it was all about 22JS. 

All in all, he did a great job of speaking from the heart, coming off sincere, etc. Now it's full steam ahead to talk about the movie!!

More to come from NYC as we have our special screening tonight and the junket starts tomorrow!
