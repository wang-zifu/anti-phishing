The Six Stages of a Crisis: Stage Three, Response




<<link>>



Hello Amy,

Response is the third stage of a crisis â€“ this phase begins after an incident occurs, when an organization reacts to a crisis. During the response stage, the emergency response plan is activated, and crisis team members begin notifying affected contacts about the incident. Communication in this phase should drive quick action to contain the incident, gain control, and minimize the effects of the emergency. 

In this paper, part three in the Six Stages of a Crisis series, communications expert Dr. Robert Chandler outlines considerations for communicating and motivating action during the response stage of a crisis.
