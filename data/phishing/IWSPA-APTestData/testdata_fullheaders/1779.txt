Steve...

This languished in my junk mail for a day ;(

Is this something you'd want us to consider???  I don't know how I'd do it from a tax deductible account but what do you think?  Do you want us to start going down this road?

Hi Janice-

I hope that this message finds you well. It's been a few months since I've reached out to you.

I am hoping that we can get on a call with Paress Salinas (copied on this email) from Overbrook Entertainment to discuss a segment that we are shooting on Thursday involving a fantastic college student for whom we have been able to secure some scholarship money. We'd like to find out from you if (a) Sony would be interested in matching the funds we've secured thus far and (b) if there are any additional organizations you think may also be interested in donating scholarship money for this deserving student.

I'm available to talk tomorrow morning. Let me know what time works for you.

Best,

Gail Huggins Porter
