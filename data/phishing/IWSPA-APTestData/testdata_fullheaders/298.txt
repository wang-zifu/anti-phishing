Hi Laura, on background:

Per the Call, The Convention Rules Committee has jurisdiction to propose the Convention agenda, permanent Rules of the Convention, proposed amendments to party rules and any other matters not covered by the other standing committees.

They do not draft the Delegate Selection Rules. That's done by the OrganizationRules & Bylaws Committee.
