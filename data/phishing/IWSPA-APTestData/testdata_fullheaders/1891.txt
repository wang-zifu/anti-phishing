Ben Carson on Fox Business, Lou Dobbs
5/17/16 7:18 PM

North Korea?
I want Kim Jung-On to realize he's not dealing with a Chump here.
He doesn't need to alienate with his actions.

He's moving deftly on foreign policy, Kissinger meeting, surprising acceleration to general?
It's a very good sign.
What's been going on before hasn't gotten us far, only turmoil.
I'm pleased he'll be talking to Kissinger. Even though he's older, he's still sharp as a tack.
He's a smart guy - and that's even more important sometimes in foreign policy than having experience. HRC has a lot of experience, but hasn't been effective.

Well Hillary Clinton... Kissinger has experience / high IQ (not sure what Lou is implying here.)

Do you see the Speaker endorsing?
I foresee that. He's a smart man and recognizes a fractured party will turn it over to the progressives.
I think he'll endorse in his own time.

I can't imagine what the due diligence Paul needs to do.
I imagine he has people he has to bring along with him, and he needs them to adjust before he can latch on.
