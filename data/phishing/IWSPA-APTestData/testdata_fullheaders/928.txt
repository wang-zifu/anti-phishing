Dear John,

I had the pleasure to discuss with you at the CGI meetings and I take the
opportunity of the beginning of the year to deliver some news on a very
promising project: how to mobilize investors to tackle climate change.

The starting point is that a fast growing number of investors realize that
climate change is not only a threat for society but in all respects, a risk
to their assets. As a side effect, by reallocating capital, from polluting
companies to carbon efficient companies, institutional investors could
accelerate the transition towards the low carbon economy (see
<<link>>
24#pg26
)

In this perspective, on the academic side, Patrick Bolton (Columbia
University), Mats Andersson (CEO of Swedish pension fund AP4) and I have
written a new paper (=E2=80=9CHedging Climate Risk=E2=80=9D and available a
t
<<link>>).

We describe low carbon indexes that are reducing climate change related
risks without impacting investment profiles. We believe it could be a game
changer: it is simple, transparent and it applies to a $10tn market.

Furthermore, we have launched a non-for domain.com coalition (Portfolio
Decarbonization Coalition) solely focused on investors that are taking
action on climate change (see <<link>>). Ban Ki-moon, Dr.
Kim, President Hollande, etc. have all referred to the Coalition in their
respective speeches and articles.

The Coalition will bring together institutional investors who are committed
to decarbonizing at least $100bn of assets. $30bn is already achieved.

I would be glad to invite you for a lunch or a breakfast to discuss about
all this when you stop in Paris, and, in the meantime, I wish to you and
your beloved ones a peaceful and Happy New Year.

Kind regards,

Fred
