Charles Sipkins and I have worked out key talking points and potential Q&A for possible media inquiries relating to "The Interview", with assistance of Nicole.  Michael has also seen this.




As discussed earlier, we all believe that at present the best approach is to maintain "NO COMMENT" stance and  recommend you to avoid any dialogue with the press on this matter in Sun Valley or any other place.  But, if it is unavoidable to give some comments, we would recommend you to deal the inquires according to the following key talking points:
