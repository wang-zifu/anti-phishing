Early flag due to DWS mention over Dem Nominating Process. Rough Transcript below.

"Yesterday, DWS said that there wouldn't be as big of a problem with uniting the party as it is with the GOP and there wouldn't be divisiveness after convention. Sen. Sanders supporters have said they won't support HRC and they claim that it is not his responsibility to get his supporters to vote for HRC. POTUS, as the head of the party, what will he do when the primary is over?"

JE: POTUS will make a case to everyone about electing the democratic nominee. He wants to continue to expand opportunity for the middle class. Every step of the way, Republicans try to block it. Voters all across the country will hear that message from POTUS.

"The GOP found themselves in this position because they were unprepared to deal with Trump as the nominee. What will POTUS do to bring the nominees together?"

JE: Perhaps. I'm not an analyst, but this isn't a small thing for the Republican Party. I feel confident that POTUS will have a strong argument for the Democratic nominee based off the progress that we have seen since he took office. There is more that we can do, but POTUS is committed to supporting a candidate who is committed to that process, which will be the Democratic Nominee.
