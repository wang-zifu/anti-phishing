Daniel - and our entire family - are lucky indeed!  Glad you had a good
run.  Steph is a wonderful, intelligent and very strong person.

And you, my friend, are quite the person yourself. Forget all the White
House stuff and the important role you have played in progressive national
and world politics.  You have never lost sight of others and never let your
position in life change your basic values.  Besides being one of the
smartest people I know, you are a genuinely good person.  I know that John
and Mary are quite proud of who you are - even more than what you have done.

Judy and I are on a cruise right now - our first - and celebrating 40 years
of marriage.  I took along "Believer" and am enjoying the tour of Chicago
political history.  When I return, I will get back to working out - not
sure how my slightly arthritic hip will be by next year, but I really do
miss running and will do my best to join you and Steph!

Take care - and stay well as you move on to the next campaign.  I am
thinking about Iowa again at the start - and Ohio at the end.
