DATA DISCOVERY: HOW MUCH DATA IS GENERATED EVERY MINUTE?

Hi Alex,
Global IP traffic has increased eight fold over the past five years, and will increase threefold over the next five years. The number of devices connected to IP networks will be nearly three times as high as the global population in 2016. Traffic from wireless devices will exceed that from wired devices by 2014. And, by 2015 61% of IP traffic will be wireless – from WiFi or mobile devices.
What are you doing to prepare? What are you doing to find your target in a sea of communications?
As an investigator or analyst, it's crucial that you're adopting technology as fast or faster than your suspects - especially in a world where data never sleeps. 
To get a visual of how much data is generated every minute, check out this infographic from Domo below.

Download our Data Discovery solution brief to learn more about searching for relevant data across disparate data sets and platforms.
