We're almost there.

John,						

Before the new year, before the ball drops, and before all the resolutions: Will you pitch in to help my campaign meet our $15,000 goal?

We're filing our last FEC report of the year and need to meet this goal to be in a strong position as we start 2016. We're still just $3,632 short!

Contribute $500, $750, or more today, before our midnight deadline:

Thank you for your support this year. I look forward to working together in 2016.

Happy New Year,

Patrick Leahy
U.S. Senator
