A quick favor to ask, or really a recommendation.  I am looking for someone to cook dinner for my family five nights a week.  Simple stuff and was wondering whether the folks at Toscana could recommend someone.  We have tried this in the past and it works best with a young sous chef who is between jobs or wants to take a break for a bit.  Hope all is well by you.  And thanks for any help you can bring to this.  M
