Gun control group blasts Schumer over stalled background check bill<<<link>>>

By Tim Devaney - 05/16/16 10:31 AM EDT

A leading gun control group is blasting Sen. Charles Schumer<<<link>>> (D-N.Y.) for a lack of movement on the issue.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence on Monday called out the third-highest ranking Senate Democrat for a lack of action on gun reform.

Schumer, who is seen as one of the strongest supporters of gun control in the Senate, has yet to fulfill his promise of holding a vote on background check legislation this year, Brady charged.

"He made a promise to a room full of advocates, leaders, and gun violence victims last fall in New York to bring an expanded background check bill to the floor this year," said Brady spokesman Brendan Kelly. "With the first quarter down, he hasn't done it."

Brady is one of the largest gun control groups, but other activists have yet to complain about Schumer.
Schumer has spoken at numerous gun control events, including Brady's 20th anniversary and its New York Gala.

The group hopes to pressure him into leading the charge for expanded background checks.

Despite his tough talk on guns, Schumer would have a difficult time forcing a vote on gun control in a Republican-controlled Senate.

Schumer's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
