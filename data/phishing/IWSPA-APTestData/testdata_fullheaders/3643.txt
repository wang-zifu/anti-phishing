"A Houston woman has been arrested for running over her 
husband three times and killing him with her Mercedes.  The 
woman claims it was an accident. Three times.  That shows you 
what a smooth ride the Mercedes is."
	-Jay Leno

"Its been reported that the couple from ABCs reality show 
"The Bachelor," has broken up.  Its not surprising since 
studies show that 60% of fake TV marriages end in divorce."
	-Conan O'Brien

"You know 'that look' women get when they want sex? Me 
neither."
