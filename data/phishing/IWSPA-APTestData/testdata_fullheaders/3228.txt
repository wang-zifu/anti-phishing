LA Times and Craft Q&A

Good evening - 

Tonight we had 2 screenings and Q&A's for American Hustle, both were full and we had turn people away.

The first screening was sponsored by the LA Times, moderated by Glenn Whipp. David and Jay Cassidy participated in the "taped" Q&A and it went very well. The audience was a mix of guild, SAG and LA Times readers. Glenn led the conversation with the development of the film while finishing and promoting Silver Linings and working with the actors. They talked about editing choices, music selections and how the music changes the editing decisions. It was upbeat and entertaining.

The second screening was a craft screening in which Sony invited ADG, CDG, MPEG, ACE,  and AMPAS.  Members of DGA and WGA attended, too. David and Jay were joined by Judy Becker, Michael Wilkinson and Linus Sandgren and it was moderated by Tim Grierson.

They discussed the authenticity and organic nature of the sets, costume, and cinematography.  Shooting 360 degrees.  Tim discussed the tone - both comedic and touchingly dramatic.  Jay spoke of his role as an editor and how it is set in the script, moments don't need to be engineered.  The statement that some of this actually happened - to help the viewer not get hung up on the truth of the story.  Referenced similarities with The Fighter and SLP. 

The audience asked questions both technical and stylistic. Overall, an engaging crafts Q&A. Many people recorded parts of the Q&A. David expressed that he was incredibly happy with the evening.
