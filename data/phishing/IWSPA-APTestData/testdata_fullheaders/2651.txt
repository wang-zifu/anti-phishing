America Votes Coalition's Grassroots Field Campaigns Fuel Historic
Progressive Gains in 2015 

The America Votes partners, over 40 of the most powerful progressive
organizations in the country, led an unprecedented grassroots campaign
throughout 2015 that helped achieve historic progressive gains from the
White House to Congress to key gubernatorial and state legislative races
and ballot initiatives.

"The America Votes partners played a vital role in achieving our
historic victories in 2008. AV partners' grassroots campaigns reached
millions of targeted voters thru door knocks, mailings and phone calls,"
said America Votes President Martin Frost. "The progressive
organizations in the AV coalition built a foundation this year that will
work to advance a progressive agenda over the next two years that will
solidify and expand our majorities in 2015 and beyond."

The following table details the cumulative impact of independent
progressive campaigns in America Vote's 14 states to persuade and
turnout targeted voters.

Important note: AV's labor partners and Working America conducted
hundreds of millions of additional contacts to their members that were
essential to progressive victories across the country and in many key
states. Those member contacts are not included in the table.

 America Votes State Highlights:

*	Obama won 12 of 14 states (exceptions-Arizona, Missouri) where
there are America Votes partners engaging in coordinated electoral
activity;
*	Democrats won Senate seats in four states where America Votes
partners engaged in coordinated activity- Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado
and New Hampshire; Oregon and Minnesota are too close to call;
*	In several key states, AV partners focused heavily on successful
down-ballot priorities. Progressives recaptured control of legislative
chambers in Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin, and expanded majorities in
Michigan and Pennsylvania.

*	Progressive backed initiatives were approved by voters in
Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Washington, and Wisconsin and AV partners
beat back right-wing efforts in Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
Massachusetts, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, and South Dakota.

	*	Choice: Initiatives that attacked a women's right to
choice were rejected by voters in Colorado, California and South Dakota.

	*	Labor Rights: Attacks on workers rights appear likely to
go down to defeat in Colorado, Oregon and North Dakota.
	*	Affirmative Action: Colorado became the first state to
reject an anti-affirmative action measure.
	*	Predatory Lending: Ohio and Arizona voters defeated
measures pushed by the predatory lending industry that sought roll back
pay day loan reforms in both states.
	*	Progressive policy solutions advanced at the ballot box
included stem cell research in Michigan, clean energy and home health
care reform in Missouri, children's health care in Montana, health care
reform (long term care) and a "Death with Dignity" initiative in
Washington, and paid sick leave in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

*	In Michigan, the right-wing chief justice of the Michigan
Supreme Court was defeated;
*	In Missouri, Democrats won the Gubernatorial race, picked up
three seats in the state senate, and passed a clean energy initiative;
*	In New Hampshire, progressives retained control of the State
Senate, which now will be the first majority-female legislative body.
