A Sheet of Plywood

Walsh for Montana 

Donate to keep John's new ad on the air! Contribute.Dear Amy, 

When I deployed to Iraq with John Walsh, we expected more than a sheet of plywood to defend our Humvees against sniper fire. 

But at the time, the Pentagon treated National Guard troops like second-class soldiers, and our substandard equipment failed to keep me safe. 

I’ll spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair – but John Walsh fought to make sure others wouldn’t. He demanded that Washington give us the resources we needed to be safe on the battlefield. 

So when I see Super PACs swiftboat John’s record – in a callous attempt to take control of the Senate – I wonder, where’s the accountability? 

I’m sharing my story to help John Walsh fight back – and we need your help, too. Will you contribute today to keep my message on the air?
