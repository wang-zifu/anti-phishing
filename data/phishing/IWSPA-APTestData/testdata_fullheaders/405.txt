John --

I wanted to make sure you saw Lindsay's email from yesterday
-- and I'd like to point something out:

Yesterday's debate over this invasive legislation showed us
once again that we're up against some elected officials that
lack a foundational understanding of science. One congresswoman,
after watching the debate, said she wondered whether high
school biology should be a requirement for running for office.

It really makes you wonder what these politicians are thinking
when they try to put themselves between a woman and her doctor
when it comes to health care decisions.

Stand up for women's health. Add your name and say you'll help
keep lawmakers out of these private decisions:

Thanks,

Jon

Subject: I can't believe this just happened:

Friend --

This just actually happened: 

The House of Representatives passed one of the most unbelievable,
unconstitutional attacks on women's health in a long time.

It's a bill written by Republican Arizona Congressman Trent Franks,
which would ban abortions after 20 weeks, except in extremely
limited circumstances -- a direct legislative challenge to Roe v. Wade.

And 228 members of Congress just voted for it.

Maybe they weren't paying attention to the reaction of Americans
across the country  last year who rejected candidates who wanted
to restrict a woman's access to safe, affordable health care.

That's a message they need to hear loud and clear right now -- if you
think politicians have no right to get between a woman and her health
decisions, add your name and say you won't stand for it:

<<link>>

This bill made it out of the House Judiciary Committee thanks to the
votes of 23 Republicans -- all men, of course.

And Rep. Franks objected when opponents tried to raise the issue of
rape, saying, "...you know, the incidence of rape resulting in
pregnancy are very low."

Women made their voices very clear last year when it came to the
extreme positions that some elected officials took on women's health.
But that hasn't stopped conservative politicians from trying to repeal
Obamacare, block the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act,
and push an agenda that uses terminology like "legitimate rape."

Making progress on smart health policy isn't easy, but when
Congress is spending its time actively trying to chip away at a
woman's rights, it feels impossible.

We can't just sit back and hope it goes away -- we need to
speak up.

OFA supporters are going to be on the front lines reminding
Congress we're here and we care about women's health.

Join the fight today:

Thanks,

Lindsay
