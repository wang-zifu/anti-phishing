Joe Biden emailed you.

Kirsten Gillibrand emailed you.

Now I'm emailing you -- again. Here's why:

-- Republicans are spending an astonishing $8 MILLION to attack me on 
Arizona T.V.
-- Andy Tobin has the full-financial backing of Boehner and the Kochs
-- and our race is still tied with 9 days left.

The numbers are frightening: Our final week ad buy deadline is in 48 hours 
and we're far, far behind on our fundraising projections.

John, there's no time to lose. If we fall short Tuesday, it'll be a 
heartbreaking setback for our Arizona campaign.

48 hours to go. Can I count on you?
