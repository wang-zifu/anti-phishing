Re: A MONSTER CALLS - official submission

Tom, let's talk when you land. We got slightly different economics from CAA - they told us the budget is 40M with Spanish rights possibly selling for up to 10M. Obviously Bayona's movies massively over perform in Spain so we should absolutely keep those rights if we proceed and if possible.

Here is the submission info.   Hannah and I spoke this am and agreed that the question is is this a movie that Sony should try to do, and then if so, whether Columbia or tristar or working together in some way would be best.

I'm actually encouraged by this initial info, as they didn't sell other territories as she intimated and I asked her please not to do.   28 gross should come down at least 5 with uk tax domain.com and uk special fx deal.   Maybe even uk-Spain co prod deal.  

I am running p and Ls.

Land in ny in 2 hours.

I got the call for the official submission of  A MONSTER CALLS. 




Bayona to direct. 35M gross budget.   The deal will exclude Spain where they have Telecinco bringing in (at least) 7M for that territory.   He wants final cut.  




He originally wanted to do this indie, but CAA convinced him to explore a partner, but if no deal feels right, he still may do this on his own.  




Belen Atienza (THE IMPOSSIBLE) will be producing this with him.  This is the head of his production company, Apaches Entertainment.  




He is doing a little more work to the script – “deepening, but nothing too drastic.”   He is also open to casting with movie stars.




Lets discuss how we move forward ASAP!
