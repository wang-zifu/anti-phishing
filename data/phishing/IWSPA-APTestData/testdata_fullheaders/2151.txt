Rough Transcript

*CHUCK TODD: *right now i have the campaign manager for bernie sanders
campaign, jeff mr. weaver, welcome. weaver. i know we've got some -- we had
some audio issues. i assume we have them fixed and everybody is hearing you
just fine.

*JEFF WEAVER: *i hope so.

*CHUCK TODD: *we'll find out. you guys put out your health care plan
tonight. i'm guessing it was ready a week ago but you picked tonight for
gamesmanship reasons, no.

*JEFF WEAVER: *so we have been working with on it for sometime. but this is
a complicated issue and we wanted to make sure we got it right and put
together a pax tax plan that would fund it progressively. i thought tonight
was appropriately and a chance for the candidates to discuss health care
which has been in the news.

*CHUCK TODD: *let's walk through the details of it. medicare for all.

*JEFF WEAVER: *yes.

*CHUCK TODD: *how do you pay for it?

*JEFF WEAVER: *in a number of ways a 6.2% payroll tax on employers, which
for ploifrs who are providing health care now is a saving of thousands and
thousands of dollars. we with will put on a 2.2% premium on households,
funded the same way, calculated like the income tax which for a family of
four makg 50 grand, they will pay $446 a year, no copayments, no
deductibles. raise the income tax rates on upper income taxpayers, fix the
estate tax and few other changes.

*CHUCK TODD: *as you know, a couple of times ago when bernie sanders was on
the show, he seemed to say that he would only raise taxes on the middle
class for one issue and that was to pay for paid leave. this is violating
that pledge, no.

*JEFF WEAVER: *what you have to appreciate and i know you do because you
follow these things, the average family is going to save $5,000 in health
care costs. so if you are a family of four making 50 grand and you have to
pay 446 to uncle sam but save $5,000 and no copayments or deductibles it
seems like a good deal.

*CHUCK TODD: *one of the arguments Clinton campaign will say is this is a
fine idea but the democratic party has spent nearly eight years litigating
health care and doing this is another eight years of litigating health
care. does the political system, can the political system handle another
health care debate.

*JEFF WEAVER: *senator sanders will be the first to toll you this will not
happen tomorrow. this is where he'd like to go. universal health care has
been a central domain.com of the democratic party since franklin dell nor
roosevelt but it would be tragic to elect a candidate who does not support
that anymore.

*CHUCK TODD: *does this mean that the senator thinks that obamacare didn't
go far enough or wasn't good enough?

*JEFF WEAVER: *he looked on the affordable care act and supported it and on
the senate committee that wrote it and strongly supported it and it is a
critically important step forward to get universal health care. no doubt
about that. major accomplishment but 29 million are still without
insurance. many people with high payments and deductibles. we did medicaid,
medicare. we have been trying to expand it than the afford tbl care act.

*CHUCK TODD: *you argue this is an evolution not a scrapping of obamacare.

*JEFF WEAVER: *absolutely.

*CHUCK TODD: *it doesn't look like i builds on.

*JEFF WEAVER: *iise fulfillment of the democratic vision since roosevelt.

*CHUCK TODD: *it doesn't build on obamacare. it does scrap it.

*JEFF WEAVER: *i don't think that is true. it incorporates the programs in
to a new comprehensive program that covers everybody. like every other
major industrial country does.

*CHUCK TODD: *one of the things watching senator sanders in this process,
it seems he hasn't been comfortable in those formats. what have you done to
get him more comfortable.

*JEFF WEAVER: *i wouldn't say that. the first debate was an opportunity to
talk about to america. the second and third debate you have seen more
interaction between him and the two candidates and this week more
engagement than in past debates.

*CHUCK TODD: *you feel the sense of urgency. in a 24-hour period, senator
sanders tried to answer two criticisms of the Clinton campaign, one on the
gun manufacturers and suddenly putting on a health care plan.

*JEFF WEAVER: *and his tax plan. everybody knows to know what the top
marginal rate.

*CHUCK TODD: *what is it.

*JEFF WEAVER: *10 million or more is 52%.

*CHUCK TODD: *what about for those 250,000 up to --

*JEFF WEAVER: *500 to 2 million is 43 and 2 million to 10 million is 48.

*CHUCK TODD: *52 is the top and a progressive rate that will have -- are we
talking six, seven. how many categories.

*JEFF WEAVER: *including the current tiers looking at four there and then
three under each. eight tiers.

*CHUCK TODD: *let me play political cynic here yochl i get the democratic
nomination. you and i both know how the republican party will characterize
this. he wants to return to tax rates we haven't seen in 50 years. this
isn't john kennedy's democratic party anymore. this is something different.

*JEFF WEAVER: *what we have seen the is time to switch and middle income
and working people are the beneficiaries of what goesen on in our so

*CHUCK TODD: *what do you think it will take for bernie sanders to go from
40 to 45% in iowa to whatever the last five to ten points he needs and who
are those voters? are they people who like him but don't think he can win?
people that like him and are wondering can he pass the commander in chief
test? who do you think it is?

*JEFF WEAVER: *i think there are three groups of people, consistent
democratic voters who obviously know secretary Clinton much better. she is
a better known commodity. independents who with we are bringing in and new
democratic voters who we are bringing in. it is not just convincing people
who are current democrats which we are trying to do but expanding the
democratic base which is why he does well in general election matchups
against republicans.

*CHUCK TODD: *the last 24 hours, tax and health care plan and last minute
to make sure that Hillary Clinton had to cram for it, huh.

*JEFF WEAVER: *we released six pages. i think the secretary can read six
pages in thee hours.

*CHUCK TODD: *thank you for coming on.
