Republican Strategy for Victory: Stall Economic  Recovery

I suppose it should come as no surprise.  The Republicans are rooting
against the  American economy and American workers.  They believe that they
 will
do  better politically in the 2015 Mid-term elections =96 and the 2015 
Presidential =96  if the economy does worse.  And for  the last twenty mont
hs they
have done everything they can to assure that  outcome. 
Of course some  will say that no, the Republicans just have a different
view of what will create  jobs than Democrats.  And that is  partly true. 

Generally their view  is that whatever is in the short-term interest of the
 big
Wall Street banks,  insurance companies, big oil and their wealthy donors i
s
what is =93good for the  economy.=94  They implemented their  program of ta
x
cuts for the rich and allowing the reckless Wall Street banks to  do whatev
er
they pleased for eight long years. The result was a $2,000 decrease  in
real income for most Americans, a massive increase in incomes for the top t
wo 
percent of the population, zero net private sector job creation, and the 

collapse of our economy.
But it=92s not  just their commitment to =93trickle down=94 economics that 
has
caused them to do  everything in their power to block economic recovery. 

They believe that their political  fortunes will rise if the fortunes of th
e
rest of us decline.  We can=92t let them be right. 
The most striking case in point is the small business jobs bill that will 

hit the Senate immediately after the recess.  The bill provides financial

incentives  to small business to create new jobs.  You=92d think that any b
ill
that infuses money into a key Republican  constituency like small business

would be met with open arms by the Republican  minority.  No such luck.  Th
ey
plan to filibuster the bill even  though many of its provisions were lifted

directly from measures authored by  Republicans. 
The Republican anti-recovery crusade began with the stimulus.  When
President Obama took office the  economy and job market were in free fall. 
 The
month he took the oath of office, the economy lost 650,000 jobs.  Virtually

every mainstream economist agreed that an emergency stimulus package  was

necessary to avoid spiraling into another Great Depression.  
In a recession the problem is not a sudden decline of the ability of the 

economy to produce goods and services.  The problem is that the web of
economic relationships is disrupted and  creates an artificial decline of d
emand
for products and services =96 a demand  domain.com.  Without adequate demand t
o 
buy their products, businesses lay off workers who have even less money to

buy  products, and the economy spirals into recession.  
Recessions  result in incredible waste.  All of  the products and services

that idle workers, plants and equipment could have  created are simply not

produced =96 meaning that the society as a whole is poorer  with fewer good
s
and services to go around. 
The solution to this problem is to create the economic demand to put 
people back to work and jump start the economy.  But the only source of tha
t
demand is  the government. 
The White House economic team =96 and many progressive economists -- 
believed that a large stimulus was  necessary to push the economy out of th
e
economic ditch and get it going  again.   But the Republicans  said no.  Ma
ny
opposed any stimulus  at all. In the end, the price for the three Republica
ns
who ultimately voted yes  was a scaled-back stimulus that turned out to be

enormously effective =96 just not  big enough to do the job. 
Even today, Republicans are campaigning against the stimulus claiming it 

didn=92t work, even though the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
analysis  finds that it created or saved 2.8 million jobs by the end of Jul
y and
will  probably have created or saved 3.5 million by the end of September. 

Without it, instead of the eight million  jobs lost as a result of the
Republican recession, we would have lost 11.5  million jobs.
But of course politically, that would have been just fine with the 
Republicans. 
The effective size of the stimulus bill was about $717 billion, not 
counting the so-called Alternative Minimum Tax fix that Republicans forced 
into 
the bill that had no stimulative effect.  Had the stimulus been $1.4
trillion, the odds are good it would have  created another 3.5 million jobs
.
Think just how  different both the economic and political situation would

be today if the  economy had generated another 3.5 million jobs in the last

20 months.  
But what about the domain.com you say?  First a good portion of the
newly-generated short-term domain.com would have  been offset by increased tax
 revenues
generated from new wages and the new  spending they created as they flowed

through the economy.  And over the long run most economists  agree that thi
s
kind of expenditure would have actually improved the domain.com  picture by
jumpstarting overall economic growth. 
In fact, most of the budget surplus generated by the Clinton economic
program  came from just that =96 the big-time economic growth of the late 1
990=92s. 
But opposing and limiting the size of the stimulus was just the beginning 

of Republican attempts to throw sand in the gears of the  recovery.
They opposed the Government rescue of GM that has proven to be one of our 

biggest economic bright spots.  Instead of going into bankruptcy, or
liquidating and costing thousands of  additional jobs, GM actually turned a
 $2.2
billion domain.com in the first half of  this year and is preparing a stock
offering that will allow the Government to  sell off its stake at a potenti
al
domain.com. GM is now hiring new workers once  again.
Then there was the marathon Republican attempt to stop the extension of 
unemployment benefits that was finally defeated by Democrats earlier this 

summer.  That delayed payment of  benefits to millions of workers and cost 
the
economy dearly. 
And there was the Republican filibuster of federal money for teachers, 
police, firefighters and other public servants.  They caused hundreds of
thousands of  state employees to be laid off or furloughed.  It finally pas
sed the
Senate with two  Republican votes, but only after it was cut in half.  It

will prevent 300,000 layoffs.  Every time a teacher is fired it not  only

damages the economy in the short run, it also permanently damages our  econ
omic
prospects =96 and ability to compete in the world =96 over the long run by 

shortchanging the education of our next generation.
All the while they have been opposing these jobs initiatives, Republicans 

have proposed =96 with a straight face =96 that we spend almost three quart
ers
of a  trillion dollars over the next 10 years on tax breaks for the top two

percent of  the population. 
And they have opposed Democratic attempts to end tax breaks to companies 

that ship jobs overseas =96 one of the most profound causes of the decline 
of 
American manufacturing.
Finally, there  was virtually unanimous Republican opposition to the
measure that began to rein  in the recklessness of the big Wall Street bank
s that
caused the collapse of the  economy in the first place. 
For the last twenty months Democrats have been pushing hard to get the 
economy out of the ditch.  Not only  have the Republicans refused to lend a

hand.  They have been actively throwing rocks  under the wheels.
The fact is they want to keep the economy in that ditch so they can  divert

attention from the fact that they were behind the wheel when it careened 

off the road.  
They hope that if they prevent it from getting back onto the pavement,  the

voters will forget about who put it in the ditch in the first place and 
blame the guys who are trying to get it out. They=92re counting on the
frustration  caused by the delay in getting the economy out of that ditch t
o be
enough that  the voters will turn once again to the culprits who put it the
re,
throw them the  keys and say =93why don=92t you try it again.=94  That, of 
course,
will require a gigantic case of national amnesia.  It would also be a
political and  economic disaster.
We can=92t let them be successful. 
In particular, the Republicans hope that the frustration and the fatigue 

of struggling with the economic situation is just enough to make a large
number  of Democratic voters give up in disgust and simply stay home on Ele
ction
 Day.  That=92s how the =931994  Republican Revolution=94 that gave us Newt

Gingrich, and culminated in the  election of George Bush, the Iraq War and 
the
collapse of the economy began.  In 1994 Democrats simply stayed  home.
We=92ve seen that movie and it ends badly.
So unless you=92re up for more tales of economic collapse =96 more stories 
of 
chaos and destruction, wasted lives and frustrated dreams =96 don=92t let t
he 
Republicans succeed.  
We have to show them that those who sacrifice the economic well-being of 

their fellow Americans for partisan political gain will not ultimately be 

rewarded with political success.
