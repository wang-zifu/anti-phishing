A case for de-emphasizing the "D" in DAM - it's your intellectual property strategies that will really make the difference

<<link>> When it comes to DAM, many companies spend lots of time focused on the usual tough challenges that come with the territory: change management, workflow, technology selection, implementation costs, metadata, etc. These are all important aspects to be sure, but the emphasis on the "digital" parts of making DAM work has frequently overshadowed what increasingly becomes the most critical point in determining the success of your DAM efforts - what are your assets really worth? How have you determined that value? What do you do if that value suddenly drops? The IP aspects of your assets should be one of if not the most important drivers of how your DAM works, what's in it, and how much should it cost in order to get the value your company expects. Falling into the "re-use" trap, overestimating the shelf life of assets, and the frequently fatal incorrect assumptions of ownership and rights in the cloud realm are all topics that should be part of DAM strategies. Rick will talk about the evolution of Pearson's thinking about IP and how that has affected their approach to DAM.

Rick Ferrie, VP, Director of Intellectual Property Management, Pearson
