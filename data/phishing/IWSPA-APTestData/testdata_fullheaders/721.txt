domain.com Polls Continue to Show Democratic Unity

domain.com polls<<<link>>> from last week's New York primary forecast a troubling sign for Republicans: seven in ten New York Democrats said they were energized by the primary process, while six in ten New York Republicans said the primary had divided their party.

But it's not only in New York...

These numbers are further evidence that Republicans are being torn apart by divisive candidates and an ugly primary process. Democratic voters are proud of their candidates, and it shows every time they go to the polls across the country. Whether they vote for Senator Sanders or Secretary Clinton, Democrats are expressing their support for a candidate they respect and admire, and will come together whomever is the nominee in November.
