SAG Q&A Tonight

Good evening - Tonight we screened American Hustle for SAG Nom Comm and select press in the Cary Grant Theatre. We had a great panel with David, Amy, Jeremy, Elisabeth, Michael Wilkinson, Jay Cassidy and Mary Vernieu moderated by Jenelle Riley from Variety.

The applause was strong and everyone stayed for the Q&A. Jenelle asked very poignant questions about acting and the process of booking a role. 

They discussed working with David on the costumes, casting and the editing process.  

The audience asked questions ranging from asking the actors if they used a dialect coach, the kissing scene with Jennifer Lawrence which Amy said was her idea, working with Bradley Cooper,   and the ability that David has to bring organic and unexpected choices from his actors.  

All in all it was a fantastic event.
