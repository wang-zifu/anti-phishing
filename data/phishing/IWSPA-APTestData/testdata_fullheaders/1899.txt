For Sony Pictures Entertainment - Free tickets to a TV taping at the Chinese Theater

Amy 

Comedian Steve Hofstetter is taping his new special, Ginger Kid, at Inside Jokes at the historic Chinese Theater in Hollywood on Feb 15th, and we wanted to invite you to be our guest at the show. We want a packed, happy crowd, so come enjoy a wonderful show! 

If you're unfamiliar, Hofstetter is the original writer for domain.com and has over 17 million views on YouTube. He'll be in Adam Carolla's new movie, he's the star of JDate's current commercial campaign, and his podcast (High Confidence, Low Self Esteem) debuted on the iTunes top 150 (to listen, go to <<link>>). And just in case there were any questions, I wanted to make it clear that this is a very adult show. Hofstetter discusses religion, politics, race, and more - his comedy heroes are Bill Hicks and George Carlin. So if that's your thing, come on out! 

To get the free tickets, Use the code GINGERKID at:
<<link>> 

The code is good for 4 tickets, and you can use the code as many times as you'd like (while supplies last). And if you want to learn more about the special, domain.com <<link>> 

Thanks so much for your time!
