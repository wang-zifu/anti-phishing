You know you need a better way to manage contracts. So what will a new system really cost? The answer can be elusive. If you've talked with a few vendors, you may have found them maddeningly vague when it comes to cost, leaving you with more questions than concrete answers. There's a reason vendors are reluctant to throw out a number that may be misleading. Companies' contract management needs are so diverse that putting a price tag on meeting them is no quick, simple thing. Yet that ballpark number is precisely what you need, in order to advocate and build a case for a new system.We've created a complimentary white paper, Budget needs for contract management solutions, to help you understand the cost drivers and the potential scale of budget required to meet your company's needs.Kind regards,The Merrill DataSite Team
