A request...

Michael and Jamie, 

It's been a while...hope you guys are well.

I wanted to ask you to support my participation in the Pan Mass Challenge this year.  As you might recall,  it's a tough 200 mile, two day bicycle ride that provides support to the Dana Farber Cancer Center in Massachusetts.  It's a ride that changes lives, including my own.  In the past, I've ridden in memory of my friends' parents and in honor of my father-in-law Sam (who survived cancer--twice).  

Here is a link to the donation page, or a check made out the Dana Farber Cancer Center can be sent to my office, ZelnickMedia Corp., 19 West 44th St., 18th Floor, NY NY 10036.

<<link>>

I'd appreciate anything you can do...

Love, 

Strauss
