I liked it.  Let's discuss this morning where we'd put it and other details. I'll call you.  DougOn Oct 31, 2014, at 4:39 PM, "Bersch, Steven" <user@domain.com> wrote:American Film Market is upon us, starting next week. We are hot on one project, which reunites the team from EVIL DEAD: Producers: Sam Raimi and Rob TapertDirector: Fede Alvarez (EVIL DEAD)Writers: Fede Alvarez, Rodo Sayagues (EVIL DEAD)Synopsis: Three teens who get away with perfectly planned home robberies have set their sights on one last payout that will get them out of crime forever. Their target: a reclusive blind man with millions of dollars in hiding.  But as soon as they break into his home, the tables are turned and they find themselves trapped and fighting for survival against a psychopath with secrets of his own.Cast: TBD (we are not expecting any significant names for the cast, ala Evil Dead).Budget: $10M We think this is a very commercial play at that budget level. While it doesn’t have the brand recognition of EVIL DEAD, we like the concept and the association of the director. As usual, we expect we would not have the contractual right to use “Sam Raimi presents” or similar domain.com but it is possible he would authorize it. We are running numbers but don’t want to hold up this submission to you; we are confident that, at a $10M budget, the P&L will look attractive; we can present it on Monday if you share our enthusiasm. Can we ask you to review it this weekend? Script and Columbia coverage are attached.  <A Man In The Dark.pdf><A MAN IN THE DARK Columbia coverage.pdf>
