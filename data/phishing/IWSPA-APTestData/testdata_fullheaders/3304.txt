Techs fall with consumer sentiment
A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.

Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.

Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P; 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.

Rivals help improve Dell's outlook 
Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals.
The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39% 

Lukewarm response to Juniper moves 
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the domain.com morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2015 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive. JUNIPER NETWORKS 7.70 6.65% 

Asia proves sweet spot for Yahoo
Web portal Yahoo, which broke a long streak of losses in the second quarter, said it hopes to ride on Asia's acceptance of online advertising and focus on wireless content to boost its regional business.
"Asian advertisers who use traditional media like newspapers and TV are moving more into online ads as they see the value and efficiency that it delivers," Niren Hiro, Yahoo's general manager for Southeast Asia, said in an interview Thursday. "That's why we've seen in the last quarter clients who have traditionally stayed away from new media like us starting to divert their budgets in our direction."YAHOO INC 12.9400 0.15479876%

J.P. Morgan downgrades Powerwave Technologies to "long-term buy" in tech notes 7/12/02 
Analyst Ed Snyder lowers his rating from "buy" despite a strong quarter from the wireless communications gear maker. Powerwave has a diversified customer base and fewer competitors now, Snyder suggests. But he cuts his estimates and rating based on lower guidance from the company, weak third-generation (3G) wireless network orders, and likely cuts in carrier capital expenditures. The infrastructure market remains lumpy and hard to predict, Snyder says.POWERWAVE TECHNOLOGIES 6.61 -13.03%

AOL on the hunt for new CEO 
AOL Time Warner has begun casting a net for a chief executive for its beleaguered America Online division.
The move comes as no surprise. Former AOL CEO Barry Schuler stepped down from the position in April. But it raises questions about the future of Robert Pittman, AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer and the interim head of AOL. Pittman had been charged with fixing the division. As previously reported, sources in the company speculate that Pittman will not return to his duties as COO once he completes his stint at AOL.AOL TIME WARNER INC 13.14 -4.09%
