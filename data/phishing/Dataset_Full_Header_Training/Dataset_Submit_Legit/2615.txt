FYI, we always have to have a press person as the contact, not Community Engagement, so since you'll be there it makes more sense.

*MEDIA ADVISORY*
TOMORROW, May 5th at 3:00 PM ET: Democrats Host Reception in Philadelphia Honoring Jewish American Heritage Month

Tomorrow, OrganizationChairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Pennsylvania State Party Chair Marcel Groen, and Democratic National Convention Committee CEO Reverend Leah D. Daughtry will host an event commemorating Jewish American Heritage Month and highlighting the contributions that Jewish-Americans have made to American society. In addition, Senator Bob Casey, and Congressman Brendan Boyle will both attend the event.

This year's JAHM theme - Jewish contributions to education - builds upon an important legacy for Jewish-Americans. Democrats know that education can be the key for parents who want to give their children a better life or a chance to escape the cycle of poverty, and we know that education is also our best defense against bigotry and ignorance in society. Jewish Americans have made major contributions to the American education system, most notably Julius Rosenwald's effort to help build more than 5,000 schools in the American South. By fighting for a better education for all Americans, Jewish Americans can do our part to repair our country and the world.

WHO: OrganizationChairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Pennsylvania State Party Chair Marcel Groen, Democratic National Convention Committee CEO Reverend Leah D. Daughtry, Senator Bob Casey, and Congressman Brendan Boyle

WHEN: TOMORROW, May 5th at 3:00 PM ET at the National Museum of American Jewish History
